#### ABSTRACT: In these 2025 Advanced Life Support Guidelines, the American Heart Association provides comprehensive

#### recommendations for the resuscitation and management of adults experiencing cardiac arrest, respiratory arrest, and

#### life-threatening cardiovascular emergencies. Based on structured evidence reviews and the latest clinical research, these

#### guidelines offer evidence-based strategies to optimize survival and patient outcomes. The 2025 guidelines provide guidance

#### for the treatment of cardiac arrest, including ventricular fibrillation, pulseless ventricular tachycardia, asystole, and pulseless

#### electrical activity, as well as peri-arrest conditions such as atrial fibrillation and flutter with rapid ventricular response.

#### Recommendations are made for defibrillation, electrical cardioversion, advanced airway management, drug therapies,

#### and intravenous access. Additionally, guidelines are provided for the use of double sequential defibrillation, head-up

#### cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and point-of-care ultrasound in the advanced life support setting. Termination of resuscitation

#### rules have been refined to guide decision-making based on the emergency medical services professional’s scope of practice.

#### Finally, these guidelines also underscore the importance of identifying causative versus secondary arrhythmias to inform the

#### appropriate timing of therapeutic strategies.

## TOP 10 TAKE-HOME MESSAGES FOR

## ADULT ADVANCED LIFE SUPPORT

#### 1. A rapid assessment of clinical stability is essen-

#### tial to direct the appropriate advanced life sup-

#### port (ALS) treatment, and these guidelines go into

#### greater depth to describe how poor organ perfu-

#### sion manifests as instability.

#### 2. Higher first-shock energy settings (≥200 J) are

#### preferable to lower settings for cardioversion of

#### atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter.

#### 3. Updated termination of resuscitation (TOR) guide-

#### lines emphasize rule application based on emer-

#### gency medical services (EMS) scope of practice

#### (basic life support [BLS], ALS, or universal TOR

#### rule [UTOR]), and that end-tidal carbon dioxide

#### (ETCO 2 ) should not be used in isolation to end

#### resuscitative efforts.

#### 4. The usefulness of vector change (VC) and double

#### sequential defibrillation (DSD) has not been estab-

#### lished as therapies for shock-refractory ventricular

#### fibrillation (VF); however, further investigation of

#### these techniques, patient candidacy, and the devel-

#### opment of new technology to optimize shock deliv-

#### ery are necessary.

#### 5. Head-up cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) use

#### is discouraged outside of the setting of rigorous

#### clinical trials with appropriate subject protections.

#### 6. Recommendations regarding outdated or extraor-

#### dinary procedures that have been replaced by

#### modern equivalents with better efficacy (eg, admin-

#### istration of intra-arrest medications via an in-place

#### endotracheal tube) have been removed.

#### 7. Use of point of care ultrasonography (POCUS) by

#### experienced professionals during cardiac arrest

#### may be considered to diagnose reversible causes

#### if it can be done without interrupting resuscitative

#### efforts (ie, CPR).

#### 8. Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia is always

#### unstable and should be treated immediately with

#### defibrillation, because delays in shock delivery

#### worsen outcomes.

#### 9. Intravenous (IV) access remains the first-line choice

#### for drug administration during cardiac arrest; how-

#### ever, intraosseous (IO) access is a reasonable alter-

#### native if IV access is not feasible or delayed.

#### 10. Arrythmias can be both the cause of and a mani-

#### festation of clinical instability. Evaluating the proxi-

#### mal cause of that instability will direct professionals

#### to the most judicious use of these guidelines.

## PREAMBLE

#### In the United States, cardiac arrest remains a significant

#### public health challenge. The incidence of EMS-treated

#### OHCA is 83.4 individuals per 100 000 population an-

#### nually.^1 Despite advancements in resuscitation sci-

#### ence, training, and systems of care, survival to hospital

#### discharge after EMS-treated OHCA remains low, at

#### approximately 10%. Immediate interventions, such as

#### high-quality CPR and timely defibrillation, are crucial for

#### improving outcomes.

#### In-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) occurs in approximately

#### 1 in 100 hospitalized adults. Data indicates that about 72.2%

#### of these patients achieve return of spontaneous circulation

#### (ROSC), with survival to hospital discharge rates around

#### 24.2%. Among those who survive to discharge, approximately

#### 85% have favorable neurological outcomes. These statistics

#### underscore the importance of ALS interventions, including

#### advanced airway management, pharmacologic therapies, and

#### coordinated postresuscitation care, in both prehospital and in-

#### hospital settings.

#### The International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation

#### (ILCOR) emphasizes the “Formula for Survival,” which

#### identifies 3 critical components for improved outcomes:

#### guidelines based on sound science, effective educa-

#### tion of resuscitation professionals, and well-functioning

#### systems of care..2 The 2025 ALS guidelines build upon

#### these principles by incorporating the latest evidence, pro-

#### moting high-quality education for ALS professionals, and

#### describing the critical decisions required to provide life-

#### saving emergency cardiovascular care.

#### This document outlines the American Heart Association

#### (AHA) recommendations for ALS interventions, drawing from

#### rigorous evidence evaluation and expert consensus. Recom-

#### mendations are tailored to the scope and practice of ALS

#### professionals, focusing on enhancing survival and functional

#### recovery. The 2025 ALS guidelines aim to provide a frame-

#### work for continued advancements in resuscitation science

#### while highlighting areas for future research and innovation.^1

## INTRODUCTION TO THE 2025 ALS

## GUIDELINES

### Scope of the Guidelines

#### The 2025 ALS guidelines provide evidence-based rec-

#### ommendations for health care professionals managing

#### adult cardiac arrest and life-threatening cardiovascular

#### emergencies. These guidelines are tailored to profes-

#### sionals with advanced training in resuscitation tech-

#### niques, incorporating a wide range of pharmacologic and

#### device-based therapies and critical interventions to opti-

#### mize survival and neurological outcomes.

#### This document complements the separately published

#### 2025 BLS guidelines, which address foundational resusci-

#### tation practices for lay rescuers and BLS- and ALS-trained

#### health care professionals. Importantly, the ALS guidelines

#### address prehospital resuscitation, in-hospital resuscitation,

#### and TOR recommendations when resuscitation has been

#### unsuccessful. There is a recognition that in the literature

#### there is differential use of the terms return of spontaneous

#### circulation (ROSC) versus return of circulation. For the pur-

#### poses of these guidelines, after CPR, when return of circu-

#### lation is achieved by mechanical means (eg, extracorporeal

#### membrane oxygenation), we use return of circulation; when

#### due to cardiac function, we use ROSC. Specific recommen-

#### dations about the training of ALS resuscitation professionals

#### are provided in Part 12: Resuscitation Education Science,^1

#### recommendations about incorporating ALS professionals

#### or procedures into systems of care are provided in Part 4:

#### Systems of Care,^2 recommendations about caring for the

#### adult patient following ROSC are provided in Part 11: Post–

#### Cardiac Arrest Care,^3 and recommendations about ethical

#### considerations in delivering or withholding ALS care are pro-

#### vided in Part 3: Ethical Considerations of Resuscitation.^4

### Organization of the Writing Group

#### ing, and education, along with AHA staff and science editors.

#### Members disclosed potential conflicts of interest before and

#### every 90 days during appointment, aligning with the AHA’s

#### policies to ensure unbiased guideline development. Disclo-

#### sure information for writing group members is in Appendix 1.

## METHODOLOGY AND

## EVIDENCE REVIEW

#### These guidelines are based on evidence evaluation con-

#### ducted by the ALS Writing Group.^5 Evidence review process-

#### es included systematic reviews, scoping reviews, and annual

#### focused evidence updates, composed by ILCOR, affiliates,

#### and individual Writing Group Members, to support robust and

#### transparent guideline development. Each of these resulted

#### in a description of the literature and exhaustive discussion

#### among Writing Group members that facilitated guideline de-

#### velopment. Details of evidence evaluation can be found in

#### Part 2: Evidence Evaluation and Guidelines Development.^6

### Class of Recommendation and Level of

### Evidence

#### Each recommendation in the 2025 ALS guidelines is as-

#### signed a Class of Recommendation (COR) to reflect its

#### strength and a Level of Evidence (LOE). The LOE is based

#### on the quality, quantity, relevance, and consistency of the

#### available evidence. In determining the COR, the writing group

#### considered the LOE and other factors, including systems is-

#### sues, economic factors, and ethical factors such as equity,

#### acceptability, and feasibility. Criteria for each COR and LOE

#### are described in Table 1. For further explanation, refer to Part

#### 2: Evidence Evaluation and Guidelines Development.^6

### Guideline Structure

#### The 2025 ALS guidelines are organized into knowledge

#### chunks, which are modular, and organized into sections

#### addressing specific clinical topics.^7 Each module includes

#### a table of recommendations, a brief synopsis, supporting

#### rationale, and references. Flow diagrams and tables clarify

#### the cascade of clinical decision-making, and hyperlinked

#### references provide access to studies and resources.

### Document Review and Approval

#### Each section of the 2025 ALS guidelines underwent rigor-

#### ous review by subject matter experts and independent peer

#### reviewers. All guidelines were reviewed and approved for

#### publication by the AHA Science Advisory and Coordinating

#### Committee and the AHA Executive Committee. Disclosure

#### information for peer reviewers is listed in Appendix 2.

## DEFIBRILLATION

Recommendations for Defibrillation Indication, Type, and Energy

COR LOE Recommendations

1 B-NR
```
1. In adult patients with cardiac arrest, defibrillators
    (using biphasic or monophasic waveforms) are
    recommended to treat tachyarrhythmias requiring
    a shock such as ventricular fibrillation or pulseless
    ventricular tachycardia.

```
2a B-R
```
2. Biphasic waveform defibrillation is preferred over
    monophasic waveform defibrillation for treatment of
    tachyarrhythmias in adult patients with cardiac arrest.

```
2a B-NR
```
3. A single shock strategy is preferred to stacked shocks
    for defibrillation in adult patients with cardiac arrest.

```
2a C-LD
```
4. It is reasonable that selection of fixed versus
    escalating energy levels for subsequent shocks
    for adults in cardiac arrest with presumed shock-
    refractory arrhythmias be based on the specific
    manufacturer’s instructions for that waveform.

```
2b B-R
```
5. If using a defibrillator capable of escalating ener-
    gies, higher energy for second and subsequent
    shocks may be considered if the initial shock fails
    to restore a perfusing rhythm in adult patients with
    cardiac arrest.

```
2b C-LD
```
6. In the absence of conclusive evidence that one bi-
    phasic waveform is superior to another in termina-
    tion of ventricular fibrillation, it may be reasonable
    to use the manufacturer’s recommended energy
    dose for the first shock in adult patients with car-
    diac arrest. If this is not known, defibrillation at the
    maximal dose may be considered.

### Synopsis

#### Along with CPR, early defibrillation is critical to survival

#### when sudden cardiac arrest is caused by ventricular fi-

#### brillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VF/pVT).1,

#### Defibrillation is most successful when administered as

#### soon as possible after the onset of VF/pVT. Conversely,

#### when VF/pVT is prolonged, depletion of the heart’s ener-

#### gy reserves can compromise the efficacy of defibrillation

#### unless replenished by a prescribed period of CPR be-

#### fore rhythm analysis. Figure 1 describes the algorithm for

#### performing shocks and other ALS interventions. Minimiz-

#### ing disruptions in CPR surrounding shock administration

#### is a high priority. Currently marketed defibrillators use

#### proprietary shock waveforms that differ in their electri-

#### cal characteristics. These deliver different peak currents

#### even at the same programmed energy setting, making

#### comparisons of shock efficacy between devices chal-

#### lenging. Technologies have been developed to diagnose

#### the underlying cardiac rhythm during CPR and to derive

#### prognostic information from the ventricular waveform

#### that may guide patient management. These technologies

#### require further validation before routine use.

#### While investigations continue to evaluate the optimal

#### waveform and current, escalating energy may also be

#### effective in termination of VF or pVT. Furthermore, opti-

#### mized pad placement for defibrillation is an important

#### factor in shock success (see Recommendation-Specific

#### Supportive Text, items 4 and 5, and the section Vector

#### Change and Double Sequential Defibrillation).

### Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text

#### 1. Emergent electric defibrillation is highly effec-

#### tive at terminating VF/pVT and other hemody-

#### namic destabilizing tachyarrhythmias (please

#### see sections on wide-complex and narrow-

#### complex tachycardias or atrial fibrillation/flutter

#### as appropriate).

#### 2. Biphasic waveform defibrillators (which deliver

#### pulses of opposite polarity) expose patients to

#### a much lower peak electric current with equiv-

#### alent or greater efficacy for terminating atrial^3

#### and ventricular tachyarrhythmias than mono-

#### phasic (single polarity) defibrillators.4–10 These

#### potential differences in safety and efficacy favor

#### preferential use of a biphasic defibrillator, when

#### available. Biphasic defibrillators have largely

#### replaced monophasic shock defibrillators which

#### were last commercially manufactured in the late

#### 1990s, however, some may still be in use.

#### 3. The rationale for a single shock strategy, in

#### which CPR is immediately resumed after the

#### first shock rather than after serial “stacked”

#### shocks (if required) is based upon several con-

#### siderations. These include the high success

#### rate of the first shock with biphasic waveforms

#### (lessening the need for successive shocks), the

#### declining success of immediate second and

#### third serial shocks when the first shock has

#### failed,^11 and the protracted interruption in CPR

#### required for a series of stacked shocks. A single

#### shock strategy results in shorter interruptions

#### in CPR and a significantly improved survival to

#### hospital admission and discharge (although not

#### 1-year survival) compared with serial “stacked”

#### shocks.12–14 It is unknown whether stacked

#### shocks or single shocks are more effective in

#### settings of a monitored witnessed arrest, spe-

#### cifically, an in-patient cardiac arrest or cardiac

#### arrest after cardiac surgery where the rhythm

#### change is monitored in real time. (See the sec-

#### tion on cardiac arrest after cardiac surgery in

#### Part 10.^15 )

#### 4 and 5. Commercially available defibrillators either pro-

#### vide fixed energy settings or allow for escalat-

#### ing energy settings; both approaches are highly

#### effective in terminating VF/pVT.^16 An optimal

#### energy setting for initial or subsequent bipha-

#### sic defibrillation, whether fixed or escalating,

#### has not been identified and is best deferred to

#### the defibrillator’s manufacturer. When a manu-

#### facturer’s specified setting is unknown, another

#### approach is to apply the maximum dose setting

#### for that device. A randomized trial comparing

#### fixed 150 J biphasic defibrillation with escalat-

#### ing higher shock energies (200–300–360 J)

#### observed similar rates of successful defibril-

#### lation and conversion to an organized rhythm

#### after the first shock. However, among patients

#### who required multiple shocks, escalating shock

#### energy resulted in a significantly higher rate of

#### conversion to an organized rhythm, although

#### overall survival did not differ between the 2

#### treatment groups.^17 An observational study com-

#### paring fixed 200 J biphasic defibrillation against

#### escalating (200-300-360 J) shocks had simi-

#### lar findings.^18 Different strategies to increase

#### current delivery from biphasic waveform shock

#### have been described, including optimizing pad-

#### skin contact, applying manual pressure to pads

#### during shock delivery (with appropriate self-

#### protective insulation precautions), or vector

#### change of pads. Vector change and double

#### sequential defibrillation are described below.^19

#### 6. There is no conclusive evidence of superiority

#### of one biphasic shock waveform over another

#### for defibrillation.^20 Given the variability in elec-

#### tric characteristics between proprietary biphasic

#### waveforms, energy settings are prespecified by

#### the manufacturer for each specific device.

2. The effectiveness of VF waveform analysis to
    guide the acute management of adults with car-
    diac arrest has not been established.

### Synopsis

#### CPR obscures interpretation of the underlying rhythm

#### because of the artifact created by chest compressions

#### on the electrocardiogram. This makes it difficult to plan

#### the next step of care and can potentially delay or even

#### misdirect drug therapies if given empirically (blindly) on

#### the basis of the patient’s presumed, but not actual, under-

#### lying rhythm. Time taken for rhythm analysis also disrupts

#### CPR. Artifact-filtering and other innovative techniques to

#### identify the underlying rhythm beneath ongoing CPR can

#### surmount these challenges and minimize interruptions in

#### chest compressions while offering a diagnostic advan-

#### tage to better direct therapies.1–6 These still require fur-

#### ther testing and validation before routine use.

### Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text

#### 1. Despite the theoretical advantages, no study

#### has evaluated artifact-filtering technologies in a

#### real-time clinical setting or validated their clini-

#### cal effectiveness compared to current resuscita-

#### tion strategies. At present, filtering algorithms are

#### strictly used for visual (manual) rhythm interpreta-

#### tion and not for automated VF/VT rhythm detec-

#### tion in automated external defibrillators during

#### ongoing CPR. Further investigation and clinical

#### validation are necessary before these technologies

#### are adopted into routine clinical practice.^7

#### 2. The electric characteristics of the VF waveform are

#### known to change over time.^8 VF waveform analy-

#### sis may be of value in predicting the success of

#### defibrillation or other therapies during the course

#### of resuscitation.9–11 The prospect of basing thera-

#### pies on a prognostic analysis of the VF waveform

#### in real time is an exciting and developing avenue of

#### new research. However, the validity, reliability, and

#### clinical effectiveness of an approach that prompts

#### or withholds shock or other therapies on the basis

#### of predictive analyses is currently uncertain. The

#### only prospective clinical trial comparing a stan-

#### dard shock-first protocol with a waveform analy-

#### sis–guided shock algorithm was underpowered,

#### however, observed no difference in ROSC.^12 The

#### consensus of the writing group is that there is cur-

#### rently insufficient evidence to support the routine

#### use of waveform analysis to guide resuscitation

#### care, but it is an area in which further research with

#### clinical validation is needed and encouraged.

    for adults in cardiac arrest with persisting VF/
    pVT after ≥3 consecutive shocks has not been
    established.

### Synopsis

#### Combined with CPR, successful defibrillation is essential

#### to survival from cardiac arrest caused by VF/VT.1,2 Defi-

#### brillation delivers shock energy (joules), creating a current

#### across the thorax from pad-to-pad.^3 Its success is influ-

#### enced by a variety of factors independent of energy setting,

#### including the electrical resistance of tissues encountered

#### (typically highest at the skin-pad interface) that can dra-

#### matically reduce current delivery,4–7 pad positions (and re-

#### sulting shock “vector”) that encompass the heart anatomi-

#### cally8–11 and concomitant high quality CPR. When these

#### are all properly managed, biphasic shock can be highly ef-

#### fective (>75% success) in terminating VF/pVT.12,

#### “Shock-resistant” and “shock-refractory” are com-

#### monly used to describe VF/pVT that continues to be seen

#### on rhythm checks after repeated shocks. In some cases

#### this is due to true failure of shock to terminate VF/pVT,

#### resulting in ongoing, incessant VF/pVT. Causes of such

#### shock failure can be related to correctable deficiencies

#### in defibrillation technique that are best addressed before

#### employing alternate shock strategies such as pad reposi-

#### tioning (vector change) or double sequential defibrillation

#### (DSD). Conversely, evidence indicates a far more com-

#### mon mechanism for VF/pVT that continues to be seen

#### on post-shock rhythm checks (≈80% of instances) is not

#### due to shock failure, but rather to VF/pVT’s recurrence

#### following successful termination by shock, an event

#### that is obscured by the ensuing period of CPR. When

#### CPR is later paused for rhythm/pulse checks, VF/pVT

#### then seen is attributed to shock failure rather than to its

#### recurrence after successful termination, which is more

#### often the actual case.12,14,15 This distinction is impor-

#### tant since recurrent VF/pVT may be better remedied by

#### post-shock rhythm stabilization therapy rather than alter-

#### ing an already successful defibrillation technique. Thus

#### labels like “shock-refractory” can be misleading when

#### they conflate different mechanisms for post-shock VF/

#### pVT, for which different treatment strategies may be

#### required. Accordingly, we propose using “persisting VF/

#### pVT” in these guidelines for patients who remain in VF/

#### pVT arrest after ≥3 consecutive shocks, when its actual

#### mechanism (incessant VF/pVT due to true shock failure

#### vs recurrent VF/pVT following successful termination by

#### shock) is not known with certainty.

### Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text

#### 1 and 2. Prior systematic reviews of low-quality evidence

#### have not reported benefit from DSD for persist-

#### ing VF.16–20 Defibrillator pad relocation, called

#### vector change (VC), an inherent feature of DSD,

#### was evaluated in only one trial as a stand-alone

#### measure. That trial (DOSE-VF), compared stan-

#### dard defibrillation, VC, and DSD in patients with

#### cardiac arrest in whom VF continued to be seen

#### on rhythm checks after 3 standard shocks. It found

#### significant improvement in survival at hospital dis-

#### charge with VC and DSD compared to standard

#### defibrillation by intention-to-treat, but notably not

#### when trial findings were analyzed by the treatment

#### strategy patients actually received.^21 Furthermore,

#### in a secondary exploratory analysis a significant

#### survival benefit from DSD was only observed in the

#### 17% of study patients in whom VF was incessant,

#### and not in the vast majority (83%) of patients in

#### whom VF recurred after a successful shock.^22 The

#### interval between each sequential “double” shock

#### required for successfully terminating VF has also

#### been shown experimentally23,24 and demonstrated

#### in DOSE-VF itself^25 to require a level of precision

#### (separated by milliseconds) unlikely to be con-

#### sistently achievable by manual activation of two

#### defibrillators. Based on its review, ILCOR’s 2023

#### International Consensus on CPR and Emergency

#### Cardiovascular Care Science With Treatment

#### Recommendations (CoSTR) judged the overall

#### supportive evidence as relatively weak when issu-

#### ing “may be considered” recommendations for

#### VC and DSD.^26 The adoption of VC or DSD into

#### routine clinical practice for persisting VF/pVT (by

#### whatever mechanism) thus requires further inves-

#### tigation, given its diagnostic and technological

#### requirements.^27 These include technologies that

#### can reliably distinguish recurrent from incessant

### Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text

#### 1. Existing evidence, including observational and

#### quasi–randomized controlled trial (RCT) data, sug-

#### gests that pacing by a transcutaneous, transvenous,

#### or transmyocardial approach during cardiac arrest

#### does not improve the likelihood of ROSC or survival,

#### regardless of the timing of pacing administration in

#### established asystole, location of arrest (in-hospital

#### or out-of-hospital), or primary cardiac rhythm (asys-

#### tole, pulseless electrical activity).3–7 Protracted inter-

#### ruptions in chest compressions while the success

#### of pacing is assessed can be detrimental to survival.

#### Specifically, attempts at electrical pacing may delay

#### evidence-based resuscitative measures, such as

#### CPR. It is not known whether the timing of pacing

#### initiation may influence pacing success such that

#### pacing may be useful in the initial minute of select

#### cases of witnessed, monitored cardiac arrest (see

#### Part 10. Special Circumstances, Cardiac Arrest After

#### Cardiac Surgery^2 ). If pacing is attempted during

#### cardiac arrest related to the special circumstances

#### described above, professionals are cautioned that

#### its performance could be at the expense of high-

#### quality CPR. Of note, this recommendation address-

#### ing electrical pacing is specifically focused upon

#### patients in cardiac arrest and does not address pre-

#### vention of cardiac arrest nor does it address the util-

#### ity of overdrive pacing for arrhythmia.

1. It is recommended that professionals first attempt
    establishing intravenous access for drug adminis-
    tration in adult patients in cardiac arrest.

```
2a A
```
2. Intraosseous access is reasonable if initial at-
    tempts at intravenous access are unsuccessful or
    not feasible for adult patients in cardiac arrest.

```

3. For appropriately trained professionals, central ve-
    nous access may be considered for adult patients
    in cardiac arrest if attempts to establish intrave-
    nous and intraosseous access are unsuccessful
    or not feasible.

### Synopsis

#### Traditionally, peripheral IV access has been used to ad-

#### minister medication during cardiac arrest. However,

#### obtaining IV access under emergent conditions can be

#### challenging because of patient characteristics and opera-

#### tor experience leading to delay in pharmacological treat-

#### ments. Alternatives to IV access for drug administration

#### include IO, central venous, intracardiac, and endotracheal

#### routes. Intracardiac drug administration was discouraged

#### in the “2000 American Heart Association Guidelines for

#### Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardio-

#### vascular Care” due to its specialized skill set require-

#### ments, potential for morbidity, and the availability of other

#### access options.^1 Similarly, drug administration via secured

#### endotracheal tube results in low blood concentrations and

#### unpredictable pharmacological effects and has also been

#### removed from the guidelines.^2 Central venous access is

#### primarily used in a hospital setting because it requires

#### specialized training to acquire and maintain proficiency.

### Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text

#### 1 and 2. The peripheral IV route for vascular access has

#### traditionally been preferred for emergency drug

#### and fluid administration during adult resuscitation.

#### The pharmacokinetic properties, acute effects, and

#### clinical efficacy of emergency drugs have primarily

#### been described for IV administration.3–6 However,

#### observational studies have noted a significant

#### increase in the use of IO access in adult OHCA,

#### despite the absence of high-quality evidence.7, 8

#### Three recent large RCTs evaluated the clinical

#### effectiveness of initial IO access compared with

#### initial IV access in adult OHCA and found no dif-

#### ferences in clinical outcomes.9–11 Each RCT used

#### a superiority design; therefore, the absence of out-

#### come differences between the two groups does

#### not indicate equivalence. An ILCOR systematic

#### review, including data from these RCTs, found that

#### the use of IO access compared with IV access

#### did not result in a statistically significant improve-

#### ment in outcomes, including survival to discharge,

#### survival with favorable neurological outcome, or

#### health-related quality of life.^12 This systematic

#### review noted lower odds of achieving sustained

#### ROSC for the IO route compared with the IV route

#### (odds ratio [OR] 0.89; 95% CI, 0.80–0.99).^12

#### Patient, EMS professional, or circumstantial char-

#### acteristics may limit successful IV access or make

#### IV access infeasible. In these cases, the available

#### evidence supports IO access as an alternative. The

#### optimal anatomical location for IO access (ie, tibial

#### or humeral) remains a knowledge gap.

#### 3. Drug administration through central venous

#### access can achieve faster circulation times and

#### higher plasma concentrations in adults in car-

#### diac arrest when compared with peripheral IV

#### administration.13–15 However, data comparing

#### clinical outcomes from cardiac arrest based on

#### different access routes, including central venous

#### access, remain limited. A small, single- center

#### study reported higher rates of ROSC among

#### participants who were randomized to femo-

#### ral or internal jugular vein access compared to

#### those with peripheral IV access, although with

#### a high risk of bias.^16 If central venous access is

#### attempted by appropriately trained profession-

#### als, special attention is required to avoid delays

#### in chest compressions or defibrillation.

### Synopsis

#### The potent vasopressor effects of epinephrine have been

#### recognized for nearly 150 years. Vasopressors increase

#### coronary perfusion pressure and increase the likelihood

#### of ROSC. Epinephrine has been shown to increase ROSC

#### and survival to hospital admission in placebo-controlled

#### RCTs, cohort studies, and registry studies, but there is lim-

#### ited evidence to support improvement in survival to hos-

#### pital discharge or functional neurologic outcome. Studies

#### comparing different dosing intervals, high-dose epineph-

#### rine, and low-dose epinephrine against standard-dose

#### epinephrine (1 mg every 3–5 minutes) have not demon-

#### strated an advantage in survival outcomes. Defining the

#### optimal number of doses or maximum dose of epinephrine

#### is a critical knowledge gap and more research is needed.

#### Vasopressin, a naturally occurring antidiuretic

#### hormone, has been studied as an alternative to epi-

#### nephrine during cardiac resuscitation. In high doses,

#### vasopressin acts as a potent vasoconstrictor and, like

#### epinephrine, increases systemic vascular resistance

#### and raises coronary perfusion pressure. However,

#### there have been no clinical trials demonstrating an

#### advantage to using vasopressin alone or vasopressin

#### in addition epinephrine over standard-dose epineph-

#### rine alone.

### Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text

#### 1. There have been no new RCTs comparing epineph-

#### rine to placebo since the publication of the 2020

#### ALS guidelines. There is consistent and compelling

#### evidence from previous RCTs, cohort, and registry

#### studies to support a potent effect of epinephrine

#### on ROSC, survival to hospital admission, and sur-

#### vival to hospital discharge.1,2 However, studies have

#### failed to show an increase in survival with functional

#### neurologic outcome.2–5 A secondary analysis of the

#### PARAMEDIC2 (Prehospital Assessment of the

#### Role of Adrenaline: Measuring the Effectiveness of

#### Drug Administration in Cardiac Arrest) trial found

#### 12-month survival favored epinephrine, whereas

#### there was no significance difference in 6-month

#### survival with functional neurologic outcome

#### between arms.^6 While there is no evidence support-

#### ing improvement in neurologic outcome, epineph-

#### rine does improve short- term survival, a prerequisite

#### to meaningful recovery. In the absence of a feasible,

#### intra-arrest method of determining the likelihood

#### of favorable neurological outcome, epinephrine

#### remains standard therapy to treat cardiac arrest.

#### 2. Existing clinical trials have used a protocol of 1

#### mg of epinephrine administered every 3 to 5 min-

#### utes.3–6 Operationally, administering epinephrine

#### every second cycle of CPR, after the initial dose,

#### meets this recommendation.

#### 3. Multiple observational studies have demonstrated

#### an association between earlier epinephrine admin-

#### istration and ROSC.^2 A post-hoc analysis of the

#### PARAMEDIC2 trial found that the effectiveness

#### of epinephrine, compared to placebo, converges at

#### approximately 20 minutes of pulselessness where

#### there is no difference in survival to hospital dis-

#### charge, 30-day survival, or functional neurologic

#### outcome with longer times to initial epinephrine

#### administration.^7

#### 4. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of RCTs

#### and cohort studies have found that epinephrine

#### is associated with improved ROSC in all rhythms,

#### but the benefit in shockable rhythms is less than

#### in nonshockable rhythms.2–4,8 One observational

#### study of IHCA demonstrated 10% lower risk-

#### adjusted survival in hospitals with the highest rates

#### of epinephrine administration prior to initial defibril-

#### lation when compared with those hospitals with the

#### lowest rates.^9 The optimal timing for epinephrine

#### in relation to defibrillation is unknown. In patients

#### with shockable rhythms, this literature supports

#### prioritizing rapid defibrillation and administering

#### epinephrine after initial attempts with CPR and

#### defibrillation are not successful.

#### 5. When compared to placebo, administration of vaso-

#### pressin improves ROSC regardless of presenting

#### rhythms and increases survival to hospital admission

#### and discharge in nonshockable rhythms.^10 However,

#### multiple systematic reviews and meta-analyses of

#### RCTs and observational studies have found no

#### difference in survival outcomes when comparing

#### vasopressin alone or vasopressin combined with

#### epinephrine versus epinephrine alone.2,10–

#### 6. Multiple RCTs have compared administration of

#### high-dose epinephrine with standard-dose, but the

#### definition of high-dose epinephrine varies widely

#### by study. There were no new RCTs published

#### since the 2020 Guidelines comparing standard-

#### dose epinephrine to any high-dose epinephrine.

#### Systematic reviews and meta-analysis of RCTs

#### have yielded mixed results.10,12 One registry-based

#### study found dosing epinephrine more frequently

#### than the standard interval may be potentially harm-

#### ful.^13 High-dose intramuscular (IM) epinephrine for

#### the treatment of OHCA, with a different pharmaco-

#### kinetic profile than traditional IV administration, has

#### also been evaluated. One single-center, before-

#### after study of 1405 OHCA patients receiving an

#### initial IM dose of epinephrine followed by standard

#### IV/IO administration shortened time to epineph-

#### rine administration and improved survival to hos-

#### pital admission, hospital survival, and favorable

#### neurologic status at hospital discharge. However,

#### the study design could not account for multiple

### Synopsis

#### Pharmacological treatment of cardiac arrest is provided (if

#### indicated) when ROSC is not achieved by CPR and de-

#### fibrillation.^1 Treatments include vasopressor agents such

#### as epinephrine (discussed in Recommendations for Va-

#### sopressor Medications During Cardiac Arrest) as well as

#### drugs without direct hemodynamic effects (nonvasopres-

#### sors) and their administration is delineated in Figure 2.

#### The latter group includes antiarrhythmic medications

#### (which include β- blockers), magnesium, sodium bicarbon-

#### ate, calcium, and steroids, many of which are commonly

#### administered by health care professionals, including EMS,

#### during cardiac arrest. Although theoretically attractive and

#### of modest benefit in animal studies, none of these thera-

#### pies have definitively demonstrated improvement in sur-

#### vival after cardiac arrest. Some, however, offer potential

#### benefit in selected populations and circumstances.

#### Guidance for the treatment of cardiac arrest due to hyper-

#### kalemia, including the use of calcium and sodium bicarbonate

#### for this indication, is presented in Electrolyte Abnormalities

#### within Part 10. Special Circumstances.^2 In addition, Part 10

#### offers guidance for the management of cardiac arrest due

#### to toxic ingestion that discusses the administration of these

#### medications in these specific circumstances. Guidance for

#### management of torsades de pointes is presented in Recom-

#### mendations for Polymorphic VT later in these guidelines.

### Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text

#### 1. The 2023 AHA focused update on adult advanced

#### cardiovascular life support^3 and ILCOR’s 2024

#### CoSTR summary^4 addressed administration of

#### parenteral antiarrhythmic medications to patients

#### with cardiac arrest unresponsive to defibrillation.

#### A large, randomized, placebo-controlled prehos-

#### discharge in bystander-witnessed arrest, with a

#### significant interaction between active drug effect

#### and witnessed arrest status, as did amiodarone in

#### EMS-witnessed arrest. When administered within

#### 8 minutes of ALS-capable EMS arrival, amioda-

#### rone also improved survival to hospital admission,

#### discharge, and functional survival at hospital dis-

#### charge.^6 This suggests the potential for a small,

#### time-dependent therapeutic window in patients

#### with rapidly recognized and treated cardiac arrest.

#### Data are insufficient to definitively distinguish

#### between the effectiveness of lidocaine and amiod-

#### arone, nor their benefit when given in combination.

#### 2. No new evidence emerged from a 2025 ILCOR

#### evidence update^7 regarding the use of other paren-

#### teral antiarrhythmic agents in cardiac arrest. These

#### include bretylium tosylate (which was recently rein-

#### troduced in the United States market with no new

#### evidence on its effectiveness or safety); sotalol

#### (which requires a slow infusion and has unknown

#### benefit when given as a bolus in cardiac arrest^8 ),

#### procainamide (also requiring slow infusion, and

#### of uncertain benefit when given by rapid infu-

#### sion as a second-line agent in cardiac arrest^9 ),

#### and beta blockers (for which the ILCOR update

#### found insufficient evidence to recommend for or

#### against use).^10 The effectiveness of these drugs

#### administered in combination for cardiac arrest has

#### not been systematically addressed and remains a

#### knowledge gap. Nifekalant is currently unavailable

#### in the United States and is therefore excluded from

#### this recommendation.

#### 3. Both the 2023 AHA focused update and ILCOR’s

#### 2023 CoSTR summary identified no new com-

#### pelling data to alter previous recommendations

#### regarding the use of steroids bundled with a vaso-

#### pressor agent in cardiac arrest.3,11 A large multi-

#### center, blinded, placebo-controlled randomized trial

#### of IHCA deploying this drug combination found

#### an improved rate of ROSC but not survival to hos-

#### pital discharge or neurological outcome, failing

#### to confirm results of 2 previous single center tri-

#### als.^12 Observational studies combining intra-arrest

#### corticosteroids with standard resuscitation have

#### demonstrated mixed outcomes.13–15 An ongoing

#### registered clinical trial (NCT06203847) may pro-

#### vide further clarity.

#### 4. The 2023 AHA focused update,^3 ILCOR’s 2023

#### CoSTR summary,^11 and a systematic review includ-

#### ing 3 RCTs,^16 found routine calcium administration

#### during cardiac arrest, including cases of refrac-

#### tory asystole and pulseless electrical activity, did

#### not improve survival to hospital discharge or neu-

#### rological outcome, with a cautionary trend toward

#### potential harm. A Get With the Guidelines regis-

#### try report also found no evidence of benefit from

#### calcium administration, independent of rhythm pre-

#### sentation, during IHCA.^17 Although the findings of

#### registry data are confounded by temporal bias (ie,

#### calcium administered as a last resort during pro-

#### longed resuscitations, where outcomes are already

#### likely poor), the randomized trial data, designed to

#### mitigate that bias, found no evidence of benefit

#### when calcium was administered immediately after

#### the first dose of epinephrine.^18 Administration of

#### calcium in special circumstances such as hyper-

#### kalemia and toxic ingestion is discussed elsewhere

#### as noted above.

#### 5. The 2023 AHA focused update found routine

#### administration of sodium bicarbonate in cardiac

#### arrest was of no benefit.^3 However, recent obser-

#### vational data examining prehospital administration

#### of sodium bicarbonate in pulseless electrical activ-

#### ity and asystole suggests a potential association

#### with improved survival.^19 As observed with calcium,

#### issues of resuscitation time bias may also apply to

#### bicarbonate, resulting in difficulty interpreting the

#### findings.20,21 Although contemporary evidence is

#### insufficient to change the recommendation, there

#### may be clinical equipoise to warrant further clinical

#### trials to assess its utility in nonshockable present-

#### ing rhythms. Use of sodium bicarbonate in special

#### circumstances such as hyperkalemia is discussed

#### elsewhere as noted above.

#### 6. The 2024 ILCOR CoSTR found intra-arrest

#### magnesium administration did not improve

#### ROSC, survival, or neurological outcome

#### regardless of the presenting cardiac arrest

#### rhythm,22–25 nor was it useful for monomorphic

#### V T.^26 Magnesium’s efficacy in the treatment of

#### torsade de pointes is addressed later in this

#### Part (see Treatment of Adults With Polymorphic

#### Ventricular Tachycardia).

### Synopsis

#### The foundation of cardiac arrest resuscitation focuses on

#### high-quality CPR, early defibrillation when indicated, and

#### guideline-directed pharmacologic therapies and airway

#### management strategies. With appropriate expertise and

#### resources, adjuncts to standard cardiac arrest resuscita-

#### tion provide additional data to support and enhance care

#### delivery. Adjuncts—such as POCUS, ETCO 2 monitoring,

#### blood gas analysis, or arterial lines—may enable the in-

#### corporation of precise physiologic parameters to opti-

#### mize individual resuscitation.

#### Head-up CPR seeks to augment conventional supine

#### CPR to increase cerebral perfusion pressure with the

#### goal of improving neurologically favorable outcome.

#### Head-up CPR has been studied as a bundle of care

#### combining mechanical chest compressions, an imped-

#### ance threshold device, and application of an automated

#### device to control sequential elevation of the head and

#### thorax during compressions.

#### While emerging but limited data exist for many of

#### these CPR adjuncts, more research is needed to inform

#### future guidelines.

### Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text

#### 1. ETCO 2 values during CPR serve as a surrogate

#### for cardiac output.1,2 A secondary analysis of the

#### Pragmatic Airway Resuscitation Trial found that

#### temporal increases in ETCO 2 were associated

#### with ROSC.^3 A systematic review of 8 observa-

#### tional studies found that an abrupt increase in

#### ETCO 2 was a predictor of ROSC; however, no

#### absolute cutoff value was identified.^4 Data sug-

#### gests that a sudden increase greater than 10

#### mm Hg may indicate ROSC,5,6 although ROSC

#### can still occur with ETCO 2 increases of less than

#### 10 mm Hg.^7 These findings may be influenced by

#### other factors known to impact ETCO 2 , including

#### minute ventilation, CPR quality, the administra-

#### tion of epinephrine or sodium bicarbonate, air-

#### way management strategies, and the etiology of

#### cardiac arrest.8,

#### 2. Multiple observational studies report the use of

#### POCUS during cardiac arrest to aid in the iden-

#### tification of potentially reversible causes of car-

#### diac arrest, such as pulmonary embolism, cardiac

#### tamponade, effusion, myocardial infarction, aortic

#### dissection, and hypovolemia. However, evidence

#### for diagnosing these target conditions is limited by

#### inconsistent clinical protocols, sonographic mea-

#### sures, and operator experience, resulting in a high

#### degree of heterogeneity among the studies with

#### a high concern for bias.^10 Furthermore, the use of

#### POCUS has been associated with longer inter-

#### ruptions in chest compressions, longer duration of

#### resuscitation, and higher rates of interventions.11,

#### Therefore, even when a user with adequate skill

#### and expertise uses POCUS during cardiac arrest,

#### attention to minimizing interruptions in CPR is a

#### priority.10,13–

#### 3. POCUS has been used to assess cardiac

#### activity and, in the absence of cardiac motion

#### in conjunction with other modalities, to termi-

#### nate resuscitative efforts.14,17–20 However, only

#### a small number of observational studies, with

#### significant limitations, including variability in the

#### definitions of sonographic findings, describe

#### its use in this setting.21–23 A single small RCT,

#### multiple systematic reviews, and a meta-anal-

#### ysis of observational studies have consistently

#### found no improvement in outcomes with the

#### use of POCUS during cardiac arrest.23–25 Future

#### research that standardizes image acquisition

#### and other study methodology to examine the

#### utility of POCUS for this indication are required.

#### An alternative modality, transesophageal echo-

#### cardiography, has the potential to provide high-

#### quality imaging of cardiac structure and function

#### without interrupting CPR. However, the utility of

#### transesophageal echocardiography during CPR

#### remains a knowledge gap.

#### 4. No adult human trials directly compare levels

#### of inspired oxygen concentration during CPR.

#### Retrospective studies have found that higher intra-

#### arrest partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli is

#### associated with survival to hospital admission,^26

#### survival to hospital discharge,^27 and survival with

#### favorable neurological outcome.^28 However, these

#### findings may be influenced by patient selection,

#### airway management strategies, and the quality of

#### resuscitation.

#### 5. Small prospective studies with significant limita-

#### tions have found arterial blood gas parameters,

#### such as partial pressure of oxygen and partial

#### pressure of carbon dioxide, to be predictive of

#### ROSC.29,30 However, both partial pressure of oxy-

#### gen and partial pressure of carbon dioxide are

#### dependent on cardiac output and can be influ-

#### enced by patient factors and the quality of CPR.

#### Additionally, numerous retrospective studies have

#### assessed intra-arrest blood gas analysis as a pre-

#### dictive tool for outcomes but suffer from similar

#### limitations, compounded by their retrospective

#### design.26–28,31–

#### 6. A retrospective study from the AHA’s Get With

#### the Guidelines-Resuscitation found the use of

#### ETCO 2 or diastolic blood pressure monitoring

#### during CPR was associated with increased rate

#### of ROSC.^39 ETCO 2 values reflect pulmonary cir-

#### culation and cardiac output1,2 and are positively

#### correlated with increased compression depth40–

(^42) and release velocity.40,41 Multiple systematic

#### reviews have found numeric ETCO 2 measures to

#### be a predictor of ROSC.4,43 An ETCO 2 less than

#### 10 mm Hg is generally associated with poor out-

#### comes, whereas values above 10 mm Hg, and

###### Downloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on January 4, 2026


###### Circulation. 2025;152(suppl 2):S538–S577. DOI: 10.1161/CIR.0000000000001376 October 21, 2025 S

#### ideally above 20 mm Hg, are associated with

#### increased rates of ROSC.^43 The combination of

#### the association of higher ETCO 2 with ROSC and

#### the findings that CPR quality can increase ETCO 2

#### suggests that targeting compressions to a value

#### of at least 10 mm Hg, and ideally 20 mm Hg

#### or greater, may indicate mechanically adequate

#### technique. Other factors known to impact ETCO 2

#### values need to be considered, including minute

#### ventilation, drug administration, airway manage-

#### ment strategies, and cardiac arrest etiology.

#### ETCO 2 monitoring is most reliable when mea-

#### sured through an endotracheal tube, but it can

#### also be used with a supraglottic airway or bag-

#### mask ventilation with unclear utility. When an

#### invasive arterial line is in place, arterial diastolic

#### pressure can approximate coronary perfusion

#### pressure and myocardial perfusion during CPR.^44

#### The use of diastolic blood pressure monitoring

#### during cardiac arrest is associated with higher

## TERMINATION OF RESUSCITATIVE

## MEASURES

```
Recommendations for Termination of Resuscitation
COR LOE Recommendations
```
```
1 B-NR
```
1. When TOR is being considered, BLS prehospital
    professionals should use the BLS TOR rule for
    adult patients in OHCA, where ALS is not avail-
    able or may be significantly delayed.

```
2a B-NR
```
2. It is reasonable for ALS prehospital professionals
    to use the ALS TOR rule to terminate resuscitation
    efforts in the field for adult patients with OHCA.

```
2a B-NR
```
3. In a tiered EMS system with both ALS and BLS
    professionals, it is reasonable to use the Universal
    TOR rule for adult patients with OHCA.

```
2b C-LD
```
4. In intubated adult patients, failure to achieve
    an end-tidal CO 2 of greater than 10 mm Hg by
    waveform capnography after 20 minutes of ALS
    resuscitation may be considered as a component
    of a multimodal approach to decide when to end
    resuscitative efforts.

```
3: Harm C-EO
```
5. In nonintubated adult patients, a specific end-tidal
    CO 2 cutoff value at any time during CPR should
    not be used as an indication to end resuscitative
    efforts.

### Synopsis

#### OHCA is a resource-intensive condition associated with

#### low rates of survival. It is important for EMS professionals

#### to differentiate patients in whom continued resuscitation is

#### futile from patients with a chance of survival who should

#### receive continued resuscitation and transportation to hos-

#### pital. This will aid in both resource use and optimizing a pa-

#### tient’s chance for survival. Using a validated TOR rule will

#### help ensure accuracy in determining futility in cardiac arrest

#### patients. Though many TOR rules have been proposed,^3

#### TOR rules that have been highly studied in North America

#### include the BLS, ALS, and UTOR rules (Figures 3 and 4).

#### TOR rules are applicable for the specific scope of prac-

#### tice of the EMS agency upon which they were validated.

#### For example, an EMS agency with only BLS-trained

#### professionals (first responders or emergency medical

#### technicians [EMTs]) the BLS TOR rule is appropriate;

#### for an EMS agency with only ALS-trained professionals,

#### the ALS TOR rule is appropriate; and for an agency or

#### system with both BLS- and ALS-trained professionals

#### (commonly referred to as a tiered-response system) the

#### UTOR rule is appropriate.

#### These TOR rules are inappropriate for populations in

#### which they have not been validated, such as for patients

#### with overdose, trauma, or IHCA. Further research is

#### needed to evaluate the appropriate application of exist-

#### ing TOR rules to gain a clearer understanding of the risks

#### and benefits associated with their use.

### Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text

#### 1. In a meta-analysis of 7 published BLS TOR studies

#### primarily in North America (33 795 patients pooled

#### from retrospective and prospective observational

#### studies), only 0.13% (95% CI, 0.03%–0.58%) of

#### patients who fulfilled the BLS termination criteria

#### survived to hospital discharge.^1 A 2024 international

#### meta-analysis^2 of 6 reclassified retrospective vali-

#### dation studies from EMS systems primarily in Asia

#### suggests that the specificity of the BLS rule, when

#### generalized outside of North America may be lower

#### than previously reported. The analysis reclassified

#### EMS agencies, included heterogeneous methodolo-

#### gies and response characteristics, and relied heavily

#### on retrospective data. These limitations highlight the

#### importance of further rigorous, prospective research

#### to validate the specificity and applicability of BLS

#### TOR rules by diverse EMS agencies.

#### 2. In a meta-analysis of 2 published retrospective

#### observational studies (10 178 patients) of the ALS

#### TOR rule, only 0.01% (95% CI, 0.00%–0.07%) of

#### patients who fulfilled the ALS termination criteria

#### survived to hospital discharge.^1 The same 2024

#### international meta- analysis described above^2 ana-

#### lyzed 17 published studies on ALS TOR patients,

#### finding a pooled specificity of 96% (95% CI,

#### 0.93–0.99).

#### 3. The UTOR rule, which uses the same criteria as the

#### BLS rule (ie, arrest not witnessed by EMS profes-

#### sionals; no shock delivered; no ROSC), has been

#### prospectively validated in combined BLS/ALS, or

#### tiered response, EMS agencies.^3 Although the rule

#### did not have adequate specificity after 6 minutes of

#### resuscitation (false-positive rate: 2.1%) it did achieve

#### better than 99% specificity after approximately 15

#### minutes of attempted resuscitation while still reduc-

#### ing transportation by half. A retrospective analysis

#### found that the application of the UTOR rule at 20

#### minutes of resuscitation was able to predict futility,

#### identifying over 99% of survivors and patients with

#### good neurological outcome.^4 Another meta-analysis^2

#### also examined the UTOR rule in 19 studies, many

#### of which had initially been classified as employing

#### the BLS TOR rule in tiered BLS + ALS EMS sys-

#### tems. After reclassification, the pooled specificity of

#### the UTOR rule was reported to be 88% (95% CI,

#### 0.88–0.94). Notably, 10 of the 11 reclassified stud-

#### ies were conducted outside of North America.

#### 4. In intubated patients, an ETCO 2 measurement

#### of less than 10 mm Hg indicates little to no car-

#### diac output. Several small retrospective studies

#### provide evidence showing that an ETCO 2 less

#### than 10 mm Hg after 20 minutes of ALS resus-

#### citation is strongly but not perfectly predictive of

#### futility.5–8 These small observational studies suffer

#### from a high risk of bias. Alternative ETCO 2 thresh-

#### olds, time points, and changes in ETCO 2 over time

#### have been proposed.9–12 The use of ETCO 2 alone

#### to predict patient outcome needs to be validated

#### in a large prospective study.^2 No data is avail-

#### able that addresses ETCO 2 measurement with

#### supraglottic airways and predicts poor outcomes.

#### Additionally, isolated ETCO 2 values greater than 20

#### mm Hg, at later stages of resuscitation, should not be

#### used in isolation as a potential indicator for continued

#### resuscitation, particularly when other prognostic indi-

#### cators are not favorable. High-quality studies assess-

#### ing the role of ETCO 2 for termination of resuscitation

#### in patients on mechanical CPR have not been con-

#### ducted and are an active area of research.

#### 5. No studies were found that specifically examined

#### the use of ETCO 2 in cardiac arrest patients without

#### an advanced airway. It is not known whether ETCO 2

#### values during bag-mask ventilation are as reliable

#### as those with an advanced airway in place. There is

#### insufficient evidence to support a universal “cutoff

#### value” of ETCO 2 for decisions about TOR in a non-

#### intubated patient.

```
6. If an advanced airway is used, either a supra-
    glottic airway or endotracheal tube can be

7. If an advanced airway is used for adults in cardiac
    arrest in the in-hospital setting by expert health
    care professionals trained in these procedures,
    either a supraglottic airway or endotracheal tube
    can be used.

8. Either bag-mask ventilation or an advanced airway
    strategy may be considered during CPR for adult
    cardiac arrest in any setting depending on the situ-
    ation and skill set of the professional.

### Synopsis

#### Airway management during cardiac arrest usually com-

#### mences with a basic strategy such as BMV. In addition, it

#### may be helpful for professionals to become proficient in

#### one advanced airway strategy—endotracheal intubation

#### (ETI) or supraglottic airway (SGA) insertion—as well as

#### a second (backup) strategy for use if they are unable to

#### establish the first-choice airway adjunct. Because place-

#### ment of an advanced airway may result in interruption

#### of chest compressions, a malpositioned device, or hyper-

#### ventilation, professionals need weigh these risks against

#### potential benefits. The 2019 focused update on use of

#### advanced airways and Part 3: Adult Basic and Advanced

#### Life Support from the 2020 Guidelines addressed the

#### use of advanced airways in cardiac arrest. The 2020

#### Guidelines state that BMV or an advanced airway strat-

#### egy may be considered during CPR for adult cardiac ar-

#### rest in any setting.1,2 A key aspect of airway management

#### decision-making is the health care professional’s airway

#### management skill and experience, frequent retraining

#### and ongoing quality improvement to minimize airway

#### management complications. Thus, the ultimate decision

#### of the use, type, and timing of an advanced airway will re-

#### quire consideration of a host of patient and professional

#### characteristics that are not easily defined in a global rec-

#### ommendation (Figure 5).

### Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text

#### 1. Frequent retraining is important to maintain a

#### health care professional’s psychomotor airway

#### management skills.3,4 The manner in which

#### this training is best accomplished is unclear.

#### Research is necessary to address the specific

#### type, amount, and frequency of training experi-

#### ences that optimize airway management perfor-

#### mance during cardiac arrest.

#### 2. Although an advanced airway can be placed

#### without interrupting chest compressions,^5 inter-

#### ruptions frequently occur. Therefore, health care

#### professionals should weigh the potential ben-

#### efits of an advanced airway with the benefits

#### of maintaining a high chest compression frac-

#### tion.6–8 This is particularly true in cardiac arrest

#### patients with shockable rhythms where CPR

#### and defibrillation must take priority due to the

#### strong association of early CPR and defibrilla-

#### tion with enhanced survival with favorable neu-

#### rological outcome. In contrast, in arrests with

#### non-shockable rhythms, early airway manage-

#### ment is possible in resuscitations where CPR

#### performance and epinephrine administration

#### have already been optimized.

#### 3. In a small clinical trial and several observational

#### studies, waveform capnography was 100%

#### specific for confirming endotracheal tube posi-

#### tion during cardiac arrest.9–11 The sensitivity of

#### waveform capnography decreases after a pro-

#### longed cardiac arrest.9–11 The use of waveform

#### capnography to assess the placement of other

#### advanced airways (eg, Combitube, laryngeal

#### mask airway) has not been studied.

#### 4. The writing group acknowledges the critical

#### roles of tracking the overall success rate for

#### systems performing ETI. This data will allow sys-

#### tems to make informed decisions as to whether

#### practice should allow for ETI, move toward SGA,

#### or simply use BMV for patients in cardiac arrest;

#### recommendations will vary depending on the

#### overall success rate in a given system. There

#### is a clear need for further research with both

#### patient- and professional- centered outcomes

#### to assess the impact of prehospital quality

#### improvement on selecting and maintaining the

#### most appropriate airway management approach

#### for EMS professionals within an agency.

#### 5 and 6. One RCT of OHCA comparing SGA (iGel) to

#### ETI in a non–physician-based EMS system (ETI

#### success, 69%) found no difference in survival

#### or survival with favorable neurologic outcome at

#### hospital discharge.^12 A second RCT of OHCA

#### comparing SGA (laryngeal tube) to ETI in a non–

#### physician-based EMS system (ETI success,

#### characteristics that are not easily defined in a

#### further research, specifically on the interface

#### between patient factors and the experience,

#### training, tools and skills of the professional.

#### 7. IHCA recommendations on advanced airway

#### management have been extrapolated from

#### OHCA. There is currently no high-certainty evi-

#### dence that suggests benefit for any specific air-

#### way management strategy for IHCA. There is a

#### need for further research to identify the IHCA

#### patient and professional characteristics in air-

#### way management that impact clinical outcomes.

#### 8. A 2024 ILCOR CoSTR summary^15 demonstrated

#### no new data to change the recommendation

#### regarding the use of BMV or advanced airway

#### strategies. One large RCT of OHCA comparing

#### BMV to ETI in a physician-based EMS system

#### showed no significant benefit for either tech-

#### nique for 28-day survival or survival with favor-

#### able neurological outcome.^16 The success rate of

#### ETI in this study was 98%, suggesting a relatively

#### optimal setting for the potential success of ETI

#### as an intervention. Further research is required to

#### determine equivalence or superiority between the

#### two approaches for acute airway management,

#### as well as any potential benefit of a stepwise

#### approach (eg, BVM followed by advanced airway

#### placement).

#### 9. A 2017 systematic review identified 1 observa-

#### tional human study and 10 animal studies com-

#### paring different ventilation rates after advanced

#### airway placement.^17 While no clear benefit from

#### a rate of 10 breaths per minute was identified,

#### no other rate was found to be superior. A 2017

#### ILCOR systematic review did not identify any new

#### evidence to alter this recommendation, which was

#### reiterated in the “2017 AHA Focused Update

#### on Adult BLS and CPR Quality: An Update to

#### the AHA Guidelines for CPR and Emergency

#### Cardiovascular Care.”18,19

### Synopsis

#### Wide-complex tachycardia (WCT) is generally defined as

#### a rhythm greater than 150/min with a QRS duration of

#### 0.12 second or more.1,2 There are 4 means of achieving

#### a wide QRS complex: (1) conduction of ventricular ori-

#### gin, (2) left or right bundle branch block, (3) conduction

#### through a bypass tract, and (4) ventricular pacing. Rarely,

#### hyperkalemia or sodium channel blockade can present

#### with a WCT. Thus, WCTs can be ventricular (VT or VF), or

#### supraventricular tachycardias resulting from mechanisms

#### 2, 3, or 4. WCT can have a monomorphic or nonmonomor-

#### phic (ie, polymorphic) QRS. Polymorphic QRS complexes

#### are typical of torsades de pointes, VF, or AF with a bypass

#### tract. Most other rhythms are monomorphic. Patients with

#### WCT can be hemodynamically stable or unstable. Hemo-

#### dynamically stable patients with WCT allow the profes-

#### sional time to obtain a 12-lead electrocardiogram, place

#### an IV, and administer IV drugs, while patients who are un-

#### stable require prompt cardioversion (Figure 6).

### Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text

#### 1. In hemodynamically unstable patients with WCT it is

#### critical to promptly restore sinus rhythm. If the patient

#### is unstable as a result of the WCT (eg, systolic blood

#### pressure <80 mm Hg or altered mentation) immedi-

#### ate synchronized cardioversion is warranted.^3

#### 2. In stable patients with WCT, vagal maneuvers or

#### adenosine may be attempted; however, if the

#### patient remains in WCT following these therapies,

#### synchronized cardioversion is recommended. If

#### time and clinical stability permits, administration of

#### procedural sedation may be appropriate.^3

#### 3. Amiodarone has a relatively slow onset of action,

#### and some solutes may cause hypotension. IV pro-

#### cainamide can also cause hypotension and must

#### be infused no faster than 50 mg/min. IV sotalol is a

#### newer agent without these concerns for hypotension.

#### Direct comparisons of efficacy are generally between

#### lidocaine and these three antiarrhythmic medications.

#### Lidocaine’s kinetic properties are less effective for VT

#### at hemodynamically tolerated rates than amiodarone,

#### procainamide, or sotalol,^4 and it is unclear if lidocaine

#### is more efficacious than placebo. Conclusions based

#### on limited available evidence from small heteroge-

#### neous human studies for the treatment of stable,

#### monomorphic VT, procainamide and sotalol each

#### appear to have similar efficacy; amiodarone was not

#### more effective than procainamide.5–9 Avoiding co-

#### administration of these drugs is important because

#### their combined effects may be arrhythmogenic. When

#### any of these drugs are administered, the immediate

#### availability of a defibrillator is encouraged because

#### each drug may convert a WCT to a more rapid, malig-

#### nant (ie, hemodynamically unstable) form, depending

#### upon its underlying cause.

#### 4. Adenosine blocks the atrioventricular (AV) node

#### and decreases automaticity. Thus, WCTs in which

#### the AV node is part of the circuit will be terminated

#### by an effective dose of adenosine as described in

#### therapies for narrow-complex tachycardia (NCT).

#### Adequate adenosine administration may momen-

#### tarily block the AV node, allowing the underlying

#### rhythm to be correctly assessed. Therefore, ade-

#### nosine can be diagnostic and therapeutic in a sta-

#### ble, regular, monomorphic WCT.10,11

#### 5. Verapamil is a calcium channel blocker that slows

#### AV node conduction, shortens the refractory period

#### of accessory pathways, and acts both as a negative

#### inotrope and vasodilator. The vasodilatory effects are

#### relatively profound, and thus, hypotension is com-

#### mon with administration. Verapamil will not terminate

#### a WCT of ventricular origin and may cause profound

#### hypotension leading to shock and cardiac arrest.12,13

#### 6. Adenosine will not terminate a WCT of ventricular

#### origin, may cause profound hypotension leading to

#### shock, or precipitate VF and cardiac arrest.14,15

### Synopsis

#### Polymorphic VT refers to a wide-complex tachycardia of

#### ventricular origin with differing configurations of the QRS

#### complex from beat to beat. However, the most critical fea-

#### ture in the diagnosis and treatment of polymorphic VT is not

#### the morphology of the rhythm but rather what is known (or

#### suspected) about the patient’s underlying QT interval. It is

#### often difficult to know whether the tachycardia is pVT or ven-

#### tricular fibrillation (VF). Most VF begins with pVT and if pVT

#### is prolonged it will usually degenerate into VF (Figure 6).

#### Torsades de pointes is a form of polymorphic VT that

#### is associated with a prolonged heart rate–corrected QT

#### interval when the rhythm is normal and VT is not present.

#### The risk for developing torsades increases when the cor-

#### rected QT interval is greater than 500 milliseconds and

#### accompanied by bradycardia.^1 Torsades can be due to an

#### inherited genetic abnormality^2 or can be caused by drugs

#### and electrolyte imbalances that lengthen the QT interval.^3

#### Conversely, polymorphic VT not associated with a long

#### QT is most often due to acute myocardial ischemia.4,5

#### Other potential causes include catecholaminergic poly-

#### morphic VT, a genetic abnormality in which polymorphic

#### VT is provoked by exercise or emotion^6 ; “short QT” syn-

#### drome, a form of polymorphic VT associated with an

#### unusually short QT interval (corrected QT interval less

#### than 330–370 milliseconds)7, 8; idiopathic right ventricular

#### outflow tract polymorphic VT; and bidirectional VT seen in

#### digitalis toxicity in which the axis of alternate QRS com-

#### plexes shifts by 180°.^9 There are no RCTs examining the

#### acute pharmacological treatment of polymorphic VT. Sup-

#### portive data, with and without long corrected QT interval,

#### are largely based on case reports and case series.

### Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text

#### 1. Regardless of the underlying QT interval, all forms of

#### polymorphic VT are considered hemodynamically and

#### electrically unstable. Episodes of polymorphic VT may

#### repeatedly recur and remit spontaneously, become

#### sustained, or degenerate to VF. When the QRS com-

#### plex of a VT is of uniform morphology, electric cardio-

#### version synchronized to the QRS complex minimizes

#### the risk of provoking VF during the vulnerable period

#### of the cardiac cycle (T wave). In contrast, polymor-

#### phic VT cannot be synchronized reliably because of

#### the differing characteristics of each QRS complex

#### and requires high-energy (maximum manufacturer’s

#### setting) unsynchronized shock. Assessment of a

#### patient’s mental status is important when the appro-

#### priateness of sedation is considered before defibril-

#### lation. While effective in terminating polymorphic VT,

#### defibrillation may not prevent its recurrence, for which

#### pharmacological therapies are often required and the

#### primary focus of subsequent recommendations.

#### 2. Torsades de pointes typically presents in a recur-

#### ring pattern of self-terminating, hemodynamically

#### unstable polymorphic VT in context of a known

#### or suspected long QT abnormality, often with an

#### associated bradycardia. Termination of torsades by

#### defibrillation may not prevent its recurrence, which

#### requires additional pharmacological interventions.

#### In small case series, IV magnesium has been effec-

#### tive in suppressing and preventing recurrences.10–13

#### Magnesium is believed to suppress fluctuations in

#### the myocardial action potential that can trigger tor-

#### sades.^14 Correcting electrolyte abnormalities, par-

#### ticularly hypokalemia, is also advisable.

#### Treatment of torsades with antiarrhythmic med-

#### ications may prolong the QT interval and promote

#### the arrhythmia. When given acutely, β-adrenergic

#### blockers can also precipitate torsades by causing

#### or worsening bradycardia. In patients with bradycar-

#### dia or pause-precipitated torsades, expert consul-

#### tation is best sought for additional measures such

#### as overdrive pacing or isoproterenol.^15 There is lit-

#### erature to support instances of medication induced

#### torsades, so prevention of drug induced prolonged

#### QT is an important priority for professionals.

#### 3. Polymorphic VT that is clearly not associated with

#### QT prolongation, is most often triggered by acute

#### myocardial ischemia or infarction and often rapidly

#### degenerates into VF.3,5 Polymorphic VT may be diffi-

#### cult to differentiate from VF initially, but, as with other

#### ventricular arrhythmias (VT and VF), is terminated

#### with immediate defibrillation. However, termination

#### of polymorphic VT with defibrillation may not prevent

#### its recurrence, requiring additional pharmacological

#### measures. No RCTs have been performed to deter-

#### mine the optimal pharmacological management of

### Synopsis

#### In most patients narrow-complex tachycardias (NCTs),

#### which include sinus tachycardia, atrial flutter, AV nodal reen-

#### trant tachycardia, AV reentrant tachycardia, and other atrial

#### tachycardia, and previously referred to imprecisely as supra-

#### ventricular tachycardia, generally are not hemodynamically

#### unstable, and health care professionals have an opportunity

#### to attempt vagal maneuvers. Adenosine may also be effec-

#### tive in terminating arrhythmias in these patients.

#### For hemodynamically unstable patients with NCTs,

#### electrical therapies are warranted (Figure 6). However,

#### there must be a reasonable expectation that the NCT is

#### causing instability rather than being a manifestation of

#### instability caused by another clinical diagnosis (eg, sep-

#### sis). Hemodynamically unstable patients with NCT may

#### have hypotension, acutely altered mental status, signs of

#### shock, chest pain, or acute heart failure. Most patients with

#### NCTs have conversion success rates of up to 98% with

#### vagal maneuvers, pharmacological management, or both,

#### described below (eg, adenosine, diltiazem, verapamil).

#### If nasally administered calcium channel blockers become

#### available in the future, they will be evaluated for their effi-

#### cacy and safety and considered for inclusion in these guide-

#### lines and the corresponding treatment algorithm.1–3

#### These recommendations are supported by the 2015

#### American College of Cardiology, AHA, and Heart Rhythm

#### Society Guidelines for the Management of Adult Patients

#### With Supraventricular Tachycardia and a 2025 evidence

#### update.

### Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text

#### 1. The Valsalva maneuver is effective in terminating 20

#### to 30% of NCTs.4,5 With modified techniques, termi-

#### nation improves to up to 50%.6–9 Vagal maneuvers

#### include having the patient blow into a 10 cc syringe,

#### bearing down, and carotid massage. However, more

#### effective approaches have been described, such as

#### passive leg raise, supine repositioning, and passive

#### leg elevation immediately after Valsalva, blowing

#### into a syringe attached to a sphygmomanometer,

#### and pressing the epigastric region 10 seconds after

#### Valsalva. When performing carotid massage, caution

#### is advised because the technique can precipitate a

#### stroke in patients with carotid atherosclerosis.

#### 2. Adenosine has demonstrated very high rates of con-

#### version of AV nodal reentrant tachycardia, AV reen-

#### trant tachycardia, and many atrial tachycardias.^10

#### It also blocks the AV node, confirming a diagnosis

#### of atrial flutter or fibrillation. Adenosine has a very

#### short half-life and may be less effective if infused

#### in a peripheral vein. Adequate dosing is assured

#### by alteration of the NCT, including termination or

#### the patient’s symptoms of flushing and a feeling

#### of dread. Adenosine may have profound effects in

#### patients with central lines or post–heart transplant

#### patients; 1 mg IV may be adequate to terminate the

#### NCT. Adenosine can cause severe bronchospasm in

#### patients with asthma, and thus, is contraindicated.

#### 3. In hemodynamically unstable patients with NCT, it

#### is critical to promptly restore sinus rhythm. If unsta-

#### ble, immediate cardioversion is warranted.^11

#### 4. Cardioversion can be used to treat stable patients

#### with NCT not responsive to vagal maneuvers

#### and pharmacological therapy.^11 Assessment of

#### a patient’s mental status and clinical stability is

#### important when the appropriateness of sedation is

#### considered before cardioversion.

#### 5. IV diltiazem and verapamil convert NCT to normal

#### sinus rhythm in 64% to 98% of patients. The effi-

#### cacy of verapamil is similar to adenosine but with

#### significant concerns for inducing hypotension.12–18

#### Diltiazem and verapamil are particularly useful in

#### patients with recurrent supraventricular tachycardia

#### after treatment with adenosine because they are

#### longer acting. Hypotension is a common side effect,

#### and these medications must be infused slowly.^19 For

#### patients with NCT and suspicion of systolic heart

#### failure, diltiazem and verapamil are best avoided.

#### 6. Intravenous β-adrenergic blockers are gener-

#### ally safe and have been shown to terminate NCT

#### in adult patients with hemodynamically stable

#### narrow-complex tachycardias that are regular.

### Synopsis

#### Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a disorganized atrial rhythm due

#### to multiple reentry (self-circulating) circuits throughout

#### atrial myocardium. Atrial flutter is a more organized

#### tachyarrhythmia caused by a single macroreentrant

#### atrial circuit. The two arrhythmias are common, often

#### co-exist, and are treated similarly. Treating AF/flutter

#### with rapid ventricular rates depends on hemodynamic

#### stability. Unstable patients and those with rate-related

#### ischemia often need urgent electrical cardioversion

#### (Figure 7). Stable patients can be treated pharmaco-

#### logically to achieve rate or rhythm control. Conversion

#### of AF/flutter greater than 48 hours in nonanticoagu-

#### lated patients risks thromboembolic events. For acute

#### AF/flutter assessed as less than 48 hours, decision-

#### making is more nuanced, requiring expert consultation

#### unless emergent cardioversion is needed. Pre-excited

#### AF/flutter (Wolff-Parkinson-White) is covered under

#### Wide-Complex Tachycardias.^1

#### Electrical cardioversion is influenced by many

#### factors. Technical features (beyond energy setting)

#### affecting shock success include pad dimensions,

#### pad location, minimizing impedance barriers, shock

#### waveform, and timing (proper electrocardiogram

#### synchronization).2,3 Clinical factors influencing cardio-

#### version outcome include body habitus, cardiac status

#### (ventricular function, atrial size), rhythm duration, and

#### concomitant medication use. Any of these, alone or

#### together, can affect outcome as much or more than

#### the energy setting itself.4,5 Apart from energy, electrical

#### cardioversion requires regard for the details of how the

#### procedure itself is conducted and the characteristics of

#### the patient in whom it is performed.^6

#### ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS Guideline for the Management

#### While an expeditious trial of medications, intrave-

#### nous fluids, or both may be appropriate in some

#### cases, unstable patients or patients with ongo-

#### ing cardiac ischemia caused or exacerbated by

#### atrial fibrillation/flutter require prompt cardio-

#### version.7–9 One should also consider whether

#### the arrhythmia is causative or secondary to a

#### rapid ventricular response driven by underly-

#### ing factors (eg, sepsis), as this may guide initial

#### pharmacologic strategies for hemodynamic sta-

#### bilization. Limited data exist on these strategies

#### in hemodynamically unstable patients; however,

#### the hemodynamic benefits of successful car-

#### dioversion have been documented.10,11 In addi-

#### tion, risk of hypotension and hypoperfusion with

#### negative inotropes has been demonstrated even

#### in normotensive patients.12–14

#### Hemodynamically unstable patients and

#### those with ongoing cardiac ischemia are likely

#### to benefit from improved hemodynamic status

#### from immediate restoration of sinus rhythm and

#### avoidance of hypotension caused by pharma-

#### cological therapies. Depending on the clinical

#### scenario, patients cardioverted from atrial fibril-

#### lation/flutter of greater than 48 hours’ duration

#### are candidates for anticoagulation. Appropriate

#### selection of patients and medications for antico-

#### agulation are addressed elsewhere and beyond

#### the scope of these guidelines.^1

#### 3. Guidance for monophasic waveform car-

#### dioversion of AF/flutter is found in previous

#### guidelines,^15 displaced by biphasic waveforms

#### due to their greater efficacy. Given propri-

#### etary differences in electrical characteristics,

#### guidelines previously deferred biphasic car-

#### dioversion energy settings to manufacturer

#### specifications.^16 However, interim randomized

#### head-to-head trials together with a network

#### meta-analysis involving >3000 AF patients

#### found that 200-J shocks achieved greater than

#### 90% cumulative cardioversion success across

#### all 3 biphasic platforms currently available in

#### the United States.6,17–21

#### Previous guidelines advocated lower energy

#### settings over concerns that higher energies

#### posed greater risk for cardiac injury and com-

#### plications.18,22–25 Subsequent clinical studies

#### observed no association between starting

#### biphasic shock energies of up to 360 J with

#### energy-associated elevations in cardiac-spe-

#### cific enzymes, postcardioversion arrhythmias,

#### cardiac dysfunction, or other sequelae.26–28

#### Notably, low-energy monophasic shocks were

#### significantly more likely to provoke VF when

#### cardioverting AF, and AF when cardioverting

#### atrial flutter than a 200-J or greater setting.^29

#### This observation is consistent with the upper

#### limit of vulnerability principle: that an energy

#### threshold exists above which a shock will

#### not induce fibrillation.30,31 A higher starting

#### energy was also found to be more efficient

#### than “starting low, titrating higher” approaches,

#### achieved greater first-shock cardioversion suc-

#### cess, required fewer overall shocks, and could

#### shorten the period of anesthesia needed for

#### serial shock attempts.18,22

#### Considering efficacy, safety, efficiency,

#### simplicity, and consistency with other profes-

#### sional guidelines, evidence supports a starting

#### energy of 200 J.16–21 Regardless of energy

#### setting, appropriate sedation for cardioversion

#### is advisable in awake patients, given shock is a

#### painful procedure.

#### 4. One approach to synchronized cardiover-

#### sion is double synchronized cardioversion.

#### Administering 2 simultaneously-synchronized

#### high-energy shocks from separate defibrilla-

#### tors and pads has been described anecdotally,

#### in small case series, and a single randomized

#### trial. As an “initial” cardioversion strategy, a mod-

#### estly-sized randomized trial comprised of class

#### II obesity patients (39% had prior cardioversion

#### attempts) found first shock efficacy improved

#### with 400 J double synchronized cardioversion

#### versus 200 J synchronized cardioversion (98%

#### versus 87%, p=0.002).^32 Although not consis-

#### tently reported, double synchronized cardiover-

#### sion has not been associated with proarrhythmia,

#### hemodynamic complications, cardiac-specific

#### enzyme elevation,^28 or postprocedure discom-

#### fort but has caused defibrillator damage.^33

#### A concern in all studies has been the

#### vagueness of procedural specifications, par-

#### ticularly how 2 independently-initiated shocks

#### from separate defibrillators being reliably

#### simultaneously-synchronized was assured.^34

#### Given the high success of optimal synchronized

#### cardioversion using biphasic waveforms, the

#### incremental benefit from double synchronized

#### cardioversion is modest.

#### 5. Organized rhythms like atrial flutter, caused by

#### a discrete reentry circuit, require less energy

#### for termination than AF, whose multiple reentry

#### circuits broadly engulf the atrial myocardium.^35

#### However, periodic transitions between the two

#### arrhythmias are common. Distinguishing AF

#### from flutter in an emergent setting with only sin-

#### gle-lead monitoring can be challenging. Studies

#### evaluating rectilinear and truncated exponen-

#### tial biphasic waveforms available in the United

#### States, while indirect and fewer in number than

#### for AF, have shown comparable cumulative

#### cardioversion success for atrial flutter between

#### these waveforms at the same energy settings,

#### ranging from 50% to 75% at 50 J, improv-

#### ing to 85% to 90% at 100 J, and approach-

#### ing 100% at 200 J.23,28,36–38 Using a higher

#### (200 J) initial energy setting for flutter cardio-

#### version also affords shorter procedural times

#### without causing cardiac injury or compromising

#### safety,23,26,36–38 accompanied by a lower risk of

#### provoking AF or undertreating AF if mistaken as

#### flutter.27,36 The likelihood of greater efficacy, effi-

#### ciency, and simplicity, without safety concerns,

#### supports a starting energy of 200 J for flutter

#### cardioversion using any currently US-marketed

#### biphasic defibrillator; incremented in the event

#### of shock failure, depending on the defibrillator’s

#### features.23,28,36,37

#### 6. Shock-refractory AF, defined as AF that

#### remains incessant after maximum-energy

#### shocks, is relatively uncommon with bipha-

#### sic shock waveforms and distinguished from

#### recurrent AF, which returns after an initially

#### successful shock. As in many situations, shock

#### success can be optimized by minimizing trans-

#### thoracic impedance^3 by improving pad-skin

#### contact and applying pad pressure; relocating

#### pads to redirect the shock vector; or adding

#### antiarrhythmic drugs to alter the defibrillation

#### threshold.2,5,6,39,40

#### Another possibility is the use of dou-

#### ble synchronized cardioversion.^41 Data on

#### this approach are limited, including proce-

#### dural uncertainties described above (item

#### 4). Observational studies found double-

#### synchronized cardioversion to be successful in

#### 75% to 100% of patients who had previously

#### failed standard cardioversion.41–43 Alternatively,

#### a large prospective observational study

#### evaluated a systematic approach to shock-

#### refractory AF. It found applied pad pressure

#### improved synchronized cardioversion success

#### from 87% to 93% and with pad repositioning

#### to 96%, after which the added increment from

#### double-synchronized cardioversion only mod-

#### estly improved to 98%.^2

```
1. IV administration of a β-adrenergic blocker or
    nondihydropyridine calcium channel antagonist is
    recommended to slow the ventricular heart rate in
    the acute setting in adult patients with atrial fibrilla-
    tion or atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response
    without preexcitation.

2. IV amiodarone can be useful for rate control in
    critically ill adult patients with atrial fibrillation with
    rapid ventricular response without preexcitation.

```
3: Harm C-LD
```
3. In adult patients with preexcitation atrial fibrillation
    or atrial flutter, digoxin, nondihydropyridine calcium
    channel antagonists, β-adrenergic blockers, and IV
    amiodarone should not be administered because
    they may increase the ventricular response and
    result in VF.

```
3: Harm C-EO
```
4. Nondihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists
    and IV β-adrenergic blockers should not be used
    in adult patients with left ventricular systolic
    dysfunction and decompensated heart failure
    because these may lead to further hemodynamic
    compromise.

#### are achievable using an intravenous nondihydropyridine

#### calcium channel antagonist (eg, diltiazem, verapamil) or

#### β-adrenergic blocker (eg, metoprolol, esmolol). Pharma-

#### cologic rhythm control (chemical cardioversion) employs

#### intravenous drugs such as amiodarone, procainamide, or

#### sotalol to convert AF/flutter to sinus rhythm and prevent

#### its recurrence. Amiodarone is unique in that it can also

#### be used for rate control in patients with heart failure in

#### whom calcium channel or β-adrenergic blockers may not

#### be tolerated.

#### These recommendations are supported by the “2023

#### ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS Guideline for the Diagnosis and

#### Management of Atrial Fibrillation” and a 2025 evidence

#### update.^1

### Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text

#### 1. Clinical trial evidence shows that nondihydropyri-

#### dine calcium channel antagonists (eg, diltiazem,

#### verapamil) and β-adrenergic blockers (eg, meto-

#### prolol, esmolol, propranolol), are effective for rate

#### control in patients with atrial fibrillation/flutter.2–9

#### Systematic reviews show that IV diltiazem improves

#### heart rate control in atrial fibrillation/flutter without

#### preexcitation with rapid ventricular response when

#### compared to IV metoprolol.10–18 However, most of

#### the included studies were limited by small sample

#### size, retrospective data, and many did not report

#### relevant clinical outcomes and comorbidities.

#### Randomized clinical trials examining verapamil are

#### lacking, thus, diltiazem is generally preferred.

#### 2. Amiodarone is effective for rate control in patients

#### with atrial fibrillation/flutter without preexcitation in

#### patients with contraindications for nondihydropyri-

#### dine calcium channel antagonists or β-adrenergic

#### blockers.2–9 Digoxin is less commonly used in

#### the acute setting because of the slow onset of

#### effect.19–21 In an observational study, the optimal

#### amiodarone dosing for heart rate control (<115–

#### 80/min) was examined in 80 critically ill patients,

#### most with cardiogenic shock or sepsis.^22 The dose

#### needed to achieve heart rate control was nearly

#### twice as high in patients with persistent versus

#### paroxysmal atrial arrhythmias, but patients who

#### were taking amiodarone prior to intensive care unit

#### admission required lower doses.

#### 3. Based on limited case reports and small case

#### series, there is concern that patients with con-

#### comitant preexcitation and atrial fibrillation or atrial

#### flutter may develop VF in response to accelerated

#### ventricular response after the administration of AV

#### nodal blocking agents such as digoxin, nondihydro-

#### pyridine calcium channel antagonists, β-adrenergic

#### blockers, or IV amiodarone.23–26 In this setting, car-

#### dioversion is recommended as the most appropri-

#### ate management.

#### 4. Because of their negative inotropic effect, non-

#### dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists (eg,

#### diltiazem, verapamil) may further decompensate

#### patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction

#### and symptomatic heart failure.^7 Patients with heart

#### failure with preserved ejection fraction may tolerate

#### better nondihydropyridine calcium channel antago-

#### nists. While β-blockers can be safe in patients with

#### cardiomyopathy, they can be harmful in patients

#### who are decompensated.20,21,27 Limited evidence

#### suggests that intravenous diltiazem may cause

#### increased risk of decompensation compared to

#### intravenous β-adrenergic blockers, but more data

#### are needed to support preferential use.^28 Multiple

#### studies have demonstrated β-adrenergic blockers

#### are safe for use in patients with chronic obstructive

#### pulmonary disease.^29 Refer to Table 2.

## INITIAL MANAGEMENT OF BRADYCARDIA

```
Recommendations for Initial Management of Bradycardia
```
```
COR LOE Recommendations
```
```
1 C-EO
```
1. In adult patients presenting with acute symp-
    tomatic bradycardia, evaluation and treatment of
    reversible causes are recommended.

```
2a B-NR
```
2. In adult patients with acute bradycardia associated
    with hemodynamic compromise, administration of
    atropine is reasonable to increase heart rate.

```
2a C-LD
```
3. In adult patients with persistent hemodynamically
    unstable bradycardia refractory to medical therapy,
    temporary transvenous pacing is reasonable to
    increase heart rate and improve symptoms.

```
2b C-LD
```
4. If bradycardia is unresponsive to atropine, IV
    adrenergic agonists with rate-accelerating effects
    (eg, epinephrine, dopamine) or transcutaneous
    pacing may be effective while the adult patient
    is prepared for emergent transvenous temporary
    pacing if required.

```
2b C-EO
```
5. Immediate pacing might be considered in unstable
    adult patients with high-degree AV block when IV/
    IO access is not available.

### Synopsis

#### Bradycardia has historically been defined as a ventricu-

#### lar heart rate of less than 60/min. However, the “2018

#### ACC/AHA/HRS Guideline on the Evaluation and Man-

#### agement of Patients With Bradycardia and Cardiac Con-

#### duction Delay” adopted a lower threshold of less than

#### 50/min, reflecting population studies that commonly use

#### this lower cutoff.^1 Bradycardia can be a normal finding

#### in healthy adults, athletes, or during sleep.^1 The clinical

#### manifestation of bradycardia ranges from stable (asymp-

#### tomatic) through symptomatic to unstable (symptomatic

#### and associated with signs of poor perfusion). Patients

#### with symptomatic bradycardia can present with dizziness

#### or light-headedness, acute altered mental status, isch-

#### emic chest discomfort, acute heart failure, hypotension, or

#### syncope due to decreased cardiac output and tissue hy-

#### poperfusion. Clinicians must evaluate bradycardia within

#### the clinical context to determine whether it is a manifesta-

#### tion of another underlying disease process (eg, myocar-

#### dial ischemia, hypoxia, electrolyte disturbance, acidosis,

#### hypothermia) or the primary driver of the clinical presen-

#### tation. Immediate treatment of symptomatic bradycardia

#### as described in Figure 8 is focused on both supporting

#### perfusion and identifying and reversing the underlying

#### cause(s). The 2018 ACC/AHA/HRS Guideline provides

#### comprehensive recommendations on the evaluation and

#### management of chronic stable and unstable bradycardia.

#### These recommendations remain supported by the

#### 2018 ACC/AHA/HRS Guideline and a 2025 evidence

#### update.

### Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text

#### 1. Symptomatic bradycardia may be caused by

#### a number of potentially reversible or treatable

#### causes, including myocardial ischemia, hypoxemia,

#### hypothyroidism, infections, structural heart disease,

#### increased vagal tone, metabolic derangement,

#### electrolyte abnormalities, or medications/toxins.^1

#### Bradycardia may be difficult to resolve without

#### addressing the underlying cause(s), underscoring

#### the importance of evaluating potential etiologies

#### while simultaneously initiating emergent stabili-

#### zation measures. A large retrospective review of

#### prehospital patients undergoing transcutaneous

#### pacing identified hypoxia and initial nonbradycardic

#### rhythms as factors associated with pacing failure

#### and increased mortality, emphasizing the critical

#### need to address underlying causes alongside sta-

#### bilization efforts.^2

#### 2. Atropine has been shown to be effective for the

#### treatment of symptomatic bradycardia in observa-

#### tional studies.3–7 In a study in patients with OHCA

#### and a nonshockable heart rhythm (asystole or

#### pulseless electrical activity), the addition of atropine

#### following epinephrine was a predictor of survival to

#### hospital admission.^8 In a study among patients with

#### IHCA, the administration of atropine for nonshock-

#### able heart rhythms did not improve survival.^9

#### 3. When symptomatic bradycardia is refractory to

#### medical management, cardiac pacing is a reason-

#### able alternative. Transcutaneous pacing is nonin-

#### vasive, can be performed quickly at bedside, and is

#### typically used as a bridge to placement of a tempo-

#### rary transvenous pacing catheter. Transcutaneous

#### pacing is often painful in the conscious patient

#### and procedural tolerance may necessitate seda-

#### tion. Evidence for transvenous pacing consists of

#### limited observational studies, many of which have

#### focused on indications and the relatively high com-

#### plication rate (including bloodstream infections and

#### pneumothorax, among others).10–13 When the heart

#### rate does not improve with medications and shock

#### persists, transvenous pacing can improve the heart

#### rate and symptoms until more definitive treatment

#### (correction of underlying cause or permanent

#### pacemaker placement) can be implemented.

#### 4. If atropine is ineffective, alternative agents to

#### increase heart rate and blood pressure or trans-

#### cutaneous pacing are reasonable alternatives. For

#### medical management of a periarrest patient, epi-

#### nephrine has gained popularity, including IV infu-

#### sion and use of “push-dose” administration for

#### acute bradycardia and hypotension. Studies on

#### push-dose epinephrine for bradycardia specifi-

#### cally are lacking, although limited data support its

#### use for hypotension.14,15 Use of push-dose vaso-

#### pressors require careful attention to correct dos-

#### ing. Medication errors and adverse hemodynamic

#### effects have been reported.^16 Dopamine infusion

#### can also increase heart rate.^17 There are limited

#### studies comparing medications to transcutaneous

#### pacing for the treatment of bradycardia. A random-

#### ized feasibility study in patients failing atropine

#### compared dopamine to transcutaneous pacing

#### and found no difference in survival to discharge.^17

#### Whether to trial transcutaneous pacing, epineph-

#### rine, dopamine, or other vasoactive agent will likely,

#### therefore, depend on clinician experience and

#### resources available.

#### 5. For severe symptomatic bradycardia causing

#### shock, if no IV or IO access is available, immedi-

#### ate transcutaneous pacing while access is being

#### pursued may be undertaken. A 2006 systematic

#### review involving seven studies of transcutaneous

#### pacing for symptomatic bradycardia and bradya-

#### systolic cardiac arrest in the prehospital setting

#### did not find a benefit from pacing compared with

#### standard ALS, although a subgroup analysis from a

#### single trial suggested a possible benefit in patients

#### with symptomatic bradycardia.^18 More recent stud-

#### ies have underscored persistent challenges for

This table represents the relationships of reviewers that may be perceived as actual or reasonably perceived conflicts of interest as reported on the Disclosure Ques-
tionnaire, which all reviewers are required to complete and submit. A relationship is considered to be “significant” if (a) the person receives $5000 or more during any
12-month period, or 5% or more of the person’s gross income; or (b) the person owns 5% or more of the voting stock or share of the entity, or owns $5000 or more of
the fair market value of the entity. A relationship is considered to be “modest” if it is less than “significant” under the preceding definition.
