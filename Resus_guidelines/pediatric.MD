ABSTRACT: The American Heart Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics provide these pediatric advanced life support
```
guidelines focusing on resuscitation during cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency cardiovascular care. These guidelines
are intended to be a resource for health care professionals to identify and treat infants and children up to 18 years of age
```
(excluding newborn infants) in the prearrest, intra-arrest, and post–cardiac arrest states as well as select other emergency care
```
situations. These guidelines apply to infants and children in various settings, including the community, prehospital environments, and
```
hospital environments. Topics presented include ventilation and advanced airway strategies during cardiopulmonary resuscitation;
```
```
drug administration and weight-based dosing of medications during cardiopulmonary resuscitation; energy doses for defibrillation;
```
```
measuring cardiopulmonary resuscitation physiology and quality; extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation; post–cardiac arrest
```
```
care related to management of core temperature, blood pressure, oxygenation/ventilation, neurologic monitoring, and seizures;
```
```
neurological prognostication post–cardiac arrest; post–cardiac arrest survivorship; family presence during cardiopulmonary
```
```
resuscitation; evaluation of sudden unexplained cardiac arrest; management of shock types; airway/intubation management;
```
```
arrhythmia management including bradycardia and tachycardia (narrow and wide complex); treatment of myocarditis/
```
```
cardiomyopathies; resuscitation of patients with single ventricle congenital heart disease; management of pulmonary hypertension;
```
and management of traumatic cardiac arrest. Lastly, important gaps in resuscitation science knowledge are identified, aiming to
encourage further scientific inquiry and provide additional evidence for future pediatric advanced life support guidelines.

TOP 10 TAKE-HOME MESSAGES
1. High-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)
is the foundation of pediatric advanced life support
```
(PALS) resuscitation for health care professionals.
```
We reaffirm the key components of high-quality
```
CPR: providing adequate chest compression rate
```
and depth, minimizing interruptions in CPR, allow-
ing full chest recoil between compressions, and pro-
viding sufficient ventilation for the pediatric patient
population while avoiding excessive ventilation.
2. For initial nonshockable rhythms, administering
epinephrine as soon as possible is associated with
favorable outcomes for infants and children in car-
diac arrest.
3. Rapid defibrillation remains the priority for cardiac
arrest with initial shockable rhythms. Administer epi-
nephrine if defibrillation is not immediately possible.
4. For infants and children with continuous invasive
arterial blood pressure monitoring in place dur-
ing CPR, diastolic blood pressure targets of ≥25
mm Hg in infants and ≥30 mm Hg in children at

least 1 year of age are now included as hemo-
dynamic goals of high-quality cardiopulmonary
resuscitation.
5. End-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) can be an indi-
cator of CPR quality, although the use of specific
ETCO2 cutoff values to guide termination of resus-
citation in infants and children is not advised.
6. Preventing hyperthermia is a critical component of
post–cardiac arrest care. Avoiding central tempera-
tures >37.5 °C can improve neurological outcomes
in infants and children who remain comatose fol-
lowing cardiac arrest.
7. For infants and children, new data support main-
taining post–cardiac arrest systolic and mean arte-
rial blood pressure greater than the 10th percentile
for age and sex.
8. Neuroprognostication after cardiac arrest in
infants and children requires multiple modalities
be assessed at various timepoints throughout the
post–cardiac arrest period. Single tests conducted
in isolation carry a risk of inaccurately predicting
neurologic outcomes.
9. After discharge from the hospital, cardiac arrest
survivors often have ongoing physical, cognitive,
and behavioral challenges and require evaluation
for appropriate therapies and interventions.
10. New data support the use of IV sotalol as an anti-
arrhythmic to treat infants and children with supra-
```
ventricular tachycardia (SVT) and cardiopulmonary
```
compromise that is unresponsive to vagal maneu-
vers, IV adenosine, and electrical synchronized
cardioversion, when expert consultation is not
available.
PREAMBLE
Every year, more than 7000 out-of-hospital cardiac ar-
```
rests (OHCA) and approximately 20 000 in-hospital car-
```
```
diac arrests (IHCA) occur in infants and children across
```
the United States.1–3 In the United States, approximately
80% of emergency medical services-treated OHCA occur
in the home.4 In contrast, the majority of IHCA arrests in
```
infants and children occur in the intensive care unit (ICU)
```
environment with incidence rates ranging from 1.8%
```
for general pediatric ICU admissions (2011–2013) 5 to
```
3.1% in pediatric cardiac ICUs, although variability exists
between centers. 6 Understanding the full spectrum of
neurologic outcomes during the weeks to months after
cardiac arrest across the pediatric age spectrum is lim-
ited by variability in reporting metrics and time to follow-
up across studies. Survival to hospital discharge rates for
OHCA range from 6% to 38%. 4,7,8 Although data on fa-
vorable neurologic outcomes among survivors of OHCA
are limited, the most recent Cardiac Arrest Registry to
Enhance Survival data demonstrate rates of 5.7% in
infants to 12.8% in older children. 4 In contrast, survival
to hospital discharge for IHCA ranges from 38% for
pulseless cardiac arrest to 66% for nonpulseless cardiac
arrest.6,9 Definitions of neurologic outcome vary across
studies, and neurologic outcomes are defined by differ-
```
ent measures (eg, Vineland Adaptive Behavioral Score or
```
```
Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category [PCPC]) and
```
different thresholds. While guideline recommendations
are based on review of combined data, readers should
pay attention to individual study measures when look-
ing for detailed information. Grossly favorable neurologic
outcomes in survivors of IHCA based on the PCPC scor-
ing system are much higher than OHCA neurological
outcome rates at approximately 64% to 89%.5,10
These guidelines contain recommendations for PALS,
excluding newborn infants, and are based on the best
available resuscitation science. The Chain of Survival
requires coordinated efforts from medical profession-
als in various disciplines, as well as from lay responders,
emergency dispatchers, and first responders in the case
of OHCA. Pediatric guidance and recommendations are
provided in “Part 6: Pediatric Basic Life Support.”11 Rec-
ommendations for resuscitation training are in “Part 12:
Resuscitation Education Science.”12 Recommendations
about systems of care are in “Part 4: Systems of Care.” 13
Recommendations for special circumstances are in “Part
10: Special Circumstances.”14 Considerations around
ethics are provided in “Part 3: Ethics.” 15
INTRODUCTION
Scope of Guidelines
These guidelines are intended to be a resource for health
care professionals to identify and treat infants and chil-
dren in the prearrest, intra-arrest, and post–cardiac ar-
rest states. These apply to infants and children in multiple
```
settings: the community, prehospital, and hospital envi-
```
ronments. Prearrest, intra-arrest, and post–cardiac arrest
topics are reviewed, including cardiac arrest in special
circumstances, such as infants and children with con-
genital heart disease.
For the purposes of the PALS guidelines, pediatric
patients are infants and children up to 18 years of age.
In contrast, pediatric basic life support guidelines apply
to infants and children without signs of puberty. Nei-
ther pediatric advanced nor basic life support guidelines
address the resuscitation of newborn infants, who are
transitioning from a fluid-filled to an air-filled environ-
ment. Resuscitation of the newborn infant is addressed
in “Part 5: Neonatal Resuscitation.”16 Although pediat-
ric basic and advanced life support guidelines may be
applied to newborn infants younger than 28 days of age
based on pathophysiology and institutional practice, neo-
natal guidelines should be followed at birth to address
unique aspects of transitional physiology. 17

Organization of the Pediatric Writing Committee
The PALS Writing Group consisted of pediatric clini-
```
cians from the American Heart Association (AHA) and
```
```
the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) including in-
```
tensivists, cardiac intensivists, cardiologists, emergency
medicine physicians, and nurses. A call for candidates
was distributed to the AHA Emergency Cardiovascular
```
Care (ECC) Committee and AAP subject matter ex-
```
perts, and volunteers with recognized expertise in pedi-
atric resuscitation were nominated by the writing group
co-chairs. Writing group members were selected by the
AHA ECC Science Subcommittee and AAP Executive
Committee and then approved by the AHA Manuscript
Oversight Committee. The AHA and AAP have rigorous
conflict of interest policies and procedures to minimize
the risk of bias or improper influence during the de-
velopment of the guidelines. Before their appointment,
writing group members and peer reviewers disclosed
```
all commercial relationships and other potential (includ-
```
```
ing intellectual) conflicts. Writing group members whose
```
research informed guideline recommendations were re-
quired to declare those conflicts during discussions and
abstain from voting on those specific recommendations.
This process is described more fully in “Part 2: Evidence
Evaluation and Guidelines Development.”18 Comprehen-
sive disclosure information for writing group members
and peer reviewers is listed in Appendixes 1 and 2.
METHODOLOGY AND
EVIDENCE REVIEW
These pediatric guidelines are based on the extensive
evidence evaluation performed in conjunction with the In-
```
ternational Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR)
```
and affiliated ILCOR member councils. Three different
```
types of evidence reviews (systematic reviews, scoping
```
```
reviews, and evidence updates) were used in the 2025
```
process. This process is described more fully in “Part 2:
Evidence Evaluation and Guidelines Development.”18
Class of Recommendation and Level of
Evidence
The writing group reviewed all relevant and current AHA
guidelines for CPR and ECC and all relevant ILCOR con-
sensus on CPR and ECC science with treatment rec-
ommendations from 2020, 2022, 2023, and 2024. 19–22
Evidence and recommendations were reviewed to deter-
mine if current guidelines should be reaffirmed, revised,
or retired or if new recommendations were needed. The
writing group then drafted, reviewed, and approved rec-
ommendations, assigning a class of recommendation
```
(COR; ie, strength) and level of evidence (LOE; ie, quality,
```
```
certainty) to each. Criteria for each COR and LOE are
```
described in Table 1.
Guideline Structure
The 2025 Guidelines are organized in discrete modules
of information on specific topics or management is-
sues.23 Each modular knowledge chunk includes a table
of recommendations using standard AHA nomenclature
of COR and LOE. Recommendations are presented in or-
```
der of COR: most potential benefit (Class 1), followed by
```
```
lesser certainty of benefit (Class 2), and finally no benefit
```
```
or potential for harm (Class 3). Following the COR, rec-
```
ommendations are ordered by the certainty of supporting
```
LOE: Level A (high-quality randomized controlled trials)
```
```
to Level C-EO (expert opinion). This order does not re-
```
flect the order in which care should be provided.
A brief synopsis is provided to put the recommenda-
tions into context with important background information
and overarching management or treatment concepts.
Recommendation-specific supportive text clarifies the
rationale and key study data supporting the recommen-
dations. When appropriate, illustrations are included.
Hyperlinked references are provided to facilitate quick
access and review.
Document Review and Approval
The writing group consists of AHA and AAP representa-
tives who voted on and approved all guideline recom-
mendations. The guideline was submitted for blinded
peer review to 10 subject matter experts nominated by
the AHA and AAP. Before their appointment, all peer
reviewers were required to disclose relationships with
industry and any other conflicts of interest, and all dis-
closures were reviewed by AHA staff. The guideline was
also reviewed and approved for publication by the AHA
Science Advisory and Coordinating Committee, the AHA
Executive Committee, and the AAP Board of Directors.
Comprehensive disclosure information for peer review-
ers is listed in Appendixes 1 and 2.
These recommendations supersede the last full set
of AHA recommendations for PALS 24 made in 2020
unless otherwise specified. For topics that did not
undergo full evidence review by the 2025 writing group,
recommendations, recommendation supportive text, and
references from the 2020 pediatric basic and advanced
life support guidelines 24 were not updated and were car-
ried over and remain as the current guidelines for 2025.
These topics are noted within the synopsis of their
respective sections.

Major Concepts
The epidemiology, pathophysiology, and common etiolo-
gies of pediatric cardiac arrest are distinct from adult
and neonatal cardiac arrest. Cardiac arrest in infants and
children does not usually result from a primary cardiac
```
cause; rather, it is most frequently the result of progres-
```
sive respiratory failure or shock. In these patients, a vari-
able period of physiologic deterioration ultimately leads
to cardiac arrest. Among children with congenital and
acquired heart disease, cardiac arrest is more often re-
lated to underlying cardiac disease although the etiology
is rarely related to coronary insufficiency or ischemia as
is commonly observed in the adult population.
Outcomes for pediatric IHCA improved dramatically
between 2000 and 2009.1 Subsequent reports of tempo-
ral changes in rates of survival to hospital discharge have
been variable with marginal improvements.2 Data from the

multicenter, hospital-based cardiac arrest registry, show
that survival to hospital discharge from pulseless pediat-
ric cardiac arrest increased from 19% in 2000 and 44%
in 2022.3 Survival increased on average 0.67% per year
and then plateaued in 2010.2 New directions of research
and therapy may be required to improve cardiac arrest
survival. In addition, more cardiac arrest events now occur
in an ICU setting, which suggests that patients at risk for
cardiac arrest are being identified sooner and transferred
to a higher level of care before cardiac arrest.2,4
Survival rates from OHCA remain less encouraging.
In a recent analysis of the Cardiac Arrest Registry to
Enhance Survival, a multicenter OHCA registry, annual
survival to hospital discharge of pediatric OHCA through
2022 ranged from 6.6% for infants younger than 1 year
of age up to 17.3% for children 13 to 18 years of age. 3
Survival rates have increased since earlier data from
the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium Epidemiologi-
cal Registry demonstrated survival rates from 3.3% for
infants <1 year of age to 8.9% for children 13 to 18
years of age.5 In this registry, survival from OHCA was
higher in regions with more arrests that were witnessed
by emergency medical services and with higher lay
responder CPR rates, stressing the importance of early
recognition and treatment of these patients.6
As survival rates from pediatric cardiac arrest have
increased, there has been a shift in focus to neurodevel-
opmental, physical, and emotional outcomes of survivors.
Studies demonstrate that a quarter of patients with favor-
able outcomes have global cognitive impairment and that
85% of older children who were reported to have favor-
able outcomes have selective neuropsychological defi-
cits at 1-year follow-up.7
The Cardiac Arrest Chain of Survival
Historically, cardiac arrest care has largely focused on the
management of the cardiac arrest itself, highlighting high-
quality CPR, early defibrillation, and effective teamwork.
However, there are aspects of prearrest and post–cardiac
arrest care that are critical to improve outcomes. As pedi-
atric IHCA survival rates have plateaued,2 the prevention
of cardiac arrest becomes even more important. IHCA
prevention includes early recognition and treatment of
cardiac arrest, such as children undergoing high-risk pro-
```
cedures (eg, infants undergoing cardiac surgery or cath-
```
```
eterization procedures), children with high-risk diagnoses
```
```
(eg, shock, pulmonary hypertension, or acute respiratory
```
```
distress syndrome), and children with severely abnormal
```
vital signs or other signs of deterioration. In the out-of-
hospital environment, lay responder CPR training, sudden
```
unexpected infant death prevention, safety initiatives (eg,
```
```
bike helmet laws), and early access to emergency care
```
are imperative. When OHCA occurs, early lay responder
CPR is critical in improving outcomes.
Following resuscitation from cardiac arrest, management
```
of the post–cardiac arrest syndrome (which may include
```
brain dysfunction, myocardial dysfunction with low cardiac
```
output, and ischemia/reperfusion injury) is important to
```
avoid known contributors to secondary injury, such as hypo-
tension.8,9 There is recognition of growing differential use of
```
the terms return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) versus
```
```
return of circulation (ROC) in the literature. For the purposes
```
of these guidelines, after CPR, when ROC is achieved by
```
native cardiac function, we use ROSC; when it has been
```
```
achieved by either mechanical support (eg, extracorporeal
```
```
membrane oxygenation, ECMO) or native cardiac function,
```
we use ROC. Accurate neuroprognostication is important to
guide caregiver discussions and decision-making.10 Finally,
given the high risk of neurodevelopmental impairment
in cardiac arrest survivors, early referral for rehabilitation
assessment and intervention is key.

VENTILATION AND ADVANCED AIRWAY
STRATEGIES DURING CPR
Recommendations for Ventilation and Advanced Airway Strategies
During CPR
COR LOE Recommendations
2a C-LD
1. In infants and children with out-of-hospital
cardiac arrest, it is reasonable to perform bag-
mask ventilation rather than advanced airway
```
interventions (tracheal intubation or supraglottic
```
```
airway [SGA] placement).
```
2b C-LD
2. In infants and children with in-hospital cardiac
arrest who do not have an advanced airway in
place, it may be reasonable to perform bag-mask
ventilation or advanced airway interventions
```
(tracheal intubation or SGA placement).
```
2b C-LD
3. When performing CPR in infants and children with
an advanced airway in place, it may be reasonable
to target a ventilation rate range of 20–30 breaths/
```
min (1 breath every 2–3 s), accounting for age
```
and clinical characteristics. Hyperventilation may
compromise hemodynamics.
Synopsis
Most pediatric IHCA and OHCA are precipitated by respi-
ratory deterioration or shock. Thus, airway management
and effective ventilation are fundamental components of
pediatric resuscitation. Although most patients can be
successfully ventilated with bag-mask ventilation, this
method requires interruptions in chest compressions and
is associated with risk of aspiration and barotrauma. Ad-
vanced airway interventions, such as tracheal intubation
or SGA placement, may improve ventilation, reduce the
risk of aspiration, and enable uninterrupted compres-
sion delivery. However, airway placement may interrupt
the delivery of compressions or result in a malpositioned
device, with catastrophic consequences if unrecognized.
Advanced airway placement requires specialized equip-
ment and skilled health care professionals and may be
difficult for professionals who do not routinely intubate
children.
In children receiving CPR with an advanced airway
in place, provision of adequate minute ventilation while
avoiding hyperventilation and associated deleterious
hemodynamic effects is critical. There are limited data
regarding ventilation rates during pediatric CPR and
determination of optimal ventilation rates deserves fur-
ther study. Other components of intra-arrest ventilation,
such as the appropriate peak end-expiratory pressure or
tidal volume, have not been studied extensively.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. A clinical trial showed that tracheal intubation and
bag-mask ventilation achieve similar rates of sur-
vival with good neurologic function in pediatric
patients with OHCA.1 Three propensity-matched
retrospective studies show similar rates of sur-
vival to discharge and survival with good neuro-
logic function when comparing advanced airway
```
placement (tracheal intubation or SGA) with bag-
```
mask ventilation in pediatric OHCA. 2–4 A fourth
propensity-matched study demonstrated lower
1-month survival and survival with favorable neu-
rologic status with advanced airway placement
```
(tracheal intubation or SGA) when compared to
```
bag-mask ventilation.5 No differences have been
observed in outcomes between SGA and tracheal
intubation in pediatric OHCA.2,3,6
2. There are limited data to compare outcomes
between bag-mask ventilation versus tracheal intu-
bation in the management of IHCA, and there are
no studies of pediatric SGA use during in-hospital
CPR. A propensity-matched retrospective cohort
study found that intubation during cardiac arrest
was associated with decreased survival to hospi-
tal discharge compared to no intubation.7 Though
there may be specific circumstances or populations
in which early advanced airway interventions are
```
beneficial (eg, children for whom bag-mask ventila-
```
tion is technically difficult, children with severe lung
```
disease), data supporting alternative approaches to
```
these situations are lacking.

DRUG ADMINISTRATION DURING
CARDIAC ARREST
Drug Administration Methods During Cardiac
Arrest
Recommendations for Drug Administration Methods During Cardiac
Arrest
COR LOE Recommendations
1 C-LD
1. Rapid initiation of vascular access (IV or IO) is
recommended for drug administration in infants
and children with cardiac arrest.
1 C-EO
2. Health care professionals caring for infants and
children with cardiac arrest should choose the
```
initial type of vascular access route (IV or IO)
```
based on availability, expertise, and timeliness.
Synopsis
Administration of vasoactive and antiarrhythmic medica-
tions is a key component of PALS during CPR. Medi-
cations, such as epinephrine, have historically been
administered via multiple routes, including endotracheal,
```
intravenous (IV) and intraosseous (IO). Due to limited
```
transalveolar drug absorption and limited pulmonary
blood flow during CPR, IV and IO administration of medi-
cations are preferred over the endotracheal route.1,2 Se-
lecting the timeliest route to deliver medication based on
clinical needs and available resources is appropriate.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. Timely provision of vasoactive and antiarrhythmic
medications during cardiac arrest is dependent
on rapid securement of vascular access across
all pediatric age ranges. IV or IO administration of
epinephrine is preferred over endotracheal admin-
istration when possible.1,2
2. IO access is a rapid, safe, and an effective ini-
tial vascular access route for pediatric cardiac
arrest.3–5 A recent systematic review did not iden-
tify any studies comparing IV versus IO for vascular
access in pediatric cardiac arrest.6 Two retrospec-
tive nontraumatic OHCA registry studies showed
that younger, more severely ill patients with lower
rates of survival were more likely to have received
IO access while older patients with higher rates
of survival were more likely to have received IV
access. 7,8 Health care professionals should con-
sider resource availability, expertise, and timeliness

(time to confirmed vascular access) when choos-
```
ing vascular access routes for drug administration.

Synopsis
Administration of medications is a key component of
PALS. Vasoactive agents, such as epinephrine, are used
to increase coronary perfusion, primarily through alpha-1
receptor agonism. The optimal timing of initial dosing
may differ in shockable cardiac arrest given the need to
prioritize defibrillation. Antiarrhythmic agents are used to
```
treat cardiac arrest with ventricular fibrillation (VF) and
```
```
pulseless ventricular tachycardia (pVT). The existing lit-
```
erature does not support routine use of other adjunctive
therapies such as sodium bicarbonate and calcium ex-
cept in special circumstances.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. A recent meta-analysis of retrospective observa-
tional studies showed that shorter time to admin-
istration of epinephrine during pediatric cardiac
arrest with initial nonshockable rhythm was associ-
ated with favorable outcomes.9–14
2. The optimal timing of administration of epinephrine
in relation to defibrillation in pediatric cardiac arrest
with shockable rhythm is unknown9 and may differ
from nonshockable arrest given the need to priori-
tize defibrillation. Observational studies of pediat-
ric OHCA have included patients with shockable
rhythm, but none reported the relationship between
initial epinephrine and timing of defibrillation.11,13,15,16
Two observational studies in adults with shockable
IHCA showed that early epinephrine, defined as
before first defibrillation or within 2 minutes after
first defibrillation, respectively, was associated with
worse outcomes.17,18 No studies have examined the
effect of epinephrine for pediatric shockable arrest
when early defibrillation is not possible.
3. The optimal interval between doses of epineph-
rine for pediatric cardiac arrest is unknown.9
Observational studies for conventional CPR have
shown mixed results. One study demonstrated that
average intervals >5 minutes between doses were
associated with increased survival compared to 1
to 5 minute intervals.19 A second study showed that
average epinephrine intervals of 3 to <5 minutes
were associated with increased survival.20 Two addi-
tional studies found that intervals of <3 minutes
between epinephrine doses were associated with
better outcomes.21,22 For pediatric patients under-
going extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscita-
```
tion (ECPR), one observational study showed that
```
after the first 10 minutes of CPR, survivors received
fewer epinephrine doses during each subsequent
10-minute interval compared to nonsurvivors. There
was no difference in survival between epinephrine
dosing intervals of ≤5 minutes and >5 minutes dur-
ing minutes 10 to 30 of CPR on adjusted analysis.23
4. In an observational study of pediatric IHCA with
VF/pVT, administration of lidocaine was associated
with higher rates of ROSC and 24-hour survival
although neither lidocaine nor amiodarone signifi-
cantly affected the odds of survival to hospital dis-
charge.24 A subsequent propensity-matched study
of pediatric IHCA with initial VF/pVT demonstrated
no difference in outcomes between patients who
received lidocaine compared to amiodarone. 25
5. A meta-analysis of sodium bicarbonate adminis-
tration during pediatric IHCA demonstrated lower
rates of survival to hospital discharge in patients
who received bicarbonate.26–33 A subsequent pro-
pensity score-weighted cohort study found that
sodium bicarbonate was associated with a lower
rate of hospital survival, but no difference in rates
of ROSC were observed.34 However, these studies
do not account for the fact that patients with longer
durations of resuscitation, which are associated with
lower survival rates, have greater exposure to medi-
cations like sodium bicarbonate. This phenomenon,
known as resuscitation time bias, may falsely impli-
cate the medication with poor survival if timing of drug
administration is not accounted for in the analysis.35
There are special circumstances in which bicarbon-
ate is used, such as sodium channel blocker toxic-
```
ity (eg, tricyclic antidepressants and cocaine)36 and
```
hyperkalemia. While a comprehensive list of special
circumstances in which sodium bicarbonate may be
beneficial has not been determined, it is important
to note that sodium bicarbonate is routinely used
```
in some of these circumstances (eg, hyperkalemia)
```
which may significantly limit the emergence of new
evidence due to lack of equipoise.37
6. A recent meta-analysis examining the administra-
tion of calcium during pediatric IHCA demonstrated
decreased survival to hospital discharge with cal-
cium administration.32,38–40 Two subsequent studies
in pediatric IHCA and arrests managed in the emer-
gency department showed similar associations.41,42
However, as noted for sodium bicarbonate, none of
the studies accounted for resuscitation time bias and
calcium may be falsely implicated in the decreased
survival rates in patients who undergo prolonged

Weight-Based Dosing of Resuscitation
Medications
Recommendations for Weight-Based Dosing of Resuscitation
Medications
COR LOE Recommendations
1 C-EO
1. For resuscitation medication dosing, it is
recommended to use the infant or child’s body
weight to calculate resuscitation drug doses while
not exceeding the recommended dose for adults.
2b B-NR
2. It may be reasonable to use body habitus or
anthropomorphic measurements to improve the
accuracy of length-based estimated weight in
infants or children, when possible.
2b C-LD
3. If the infant or child’s weight is unknown, a body
length tape for estimating weight and other
cognitive aids to calculate resuscitation drug
dosing and administration may be considered.
Synopsis
Medication dosing for children is based on weight, which
is often difficult to obtain in an emergency setting. There
are numerous approaches to estimating weight when an
actual weight cannot be obtained.43
This topic was last reviewed in the 2020 AHA Guide-
lines for CPR and ECC. These recommendations have
not been re-reviewed and updated for this edition of the
Guidelines.44
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. There are many theoretical concerns about the use
```
of actual body weight (especially in overweight or
```
```
obese patients).45–47 However, there are no data
```
about the safety and efficacy of adjusting medi-
cation dosing in obese patients. Such adjustments
could result in inaccurate dosing of medications.48,49
2. Several studies suggest that inclusion of body
habitus or anthropometric measurements further
refines and improves weight estimations using
length-based measures.43 However, there are
considerable variations in these methods, and the
training required to employ these measures may
not be practical in every context.
3. Cognitive aids such as the Broselow, PAWPER XL,
and Mercy tapes can assist in the accurate approx-
```
imation of body weight (described as being within
```
```
10% to 20% of measured total body weight).
```
Several studies demonstrated high variability of
weight estimates, with a tendency toward under-
estimation of total body weight yet closely approxi-
mating ideal body weight.47,50,51

ENERGY DOSES FOR DEFIBRILLATION IN
CARDIAC ARREST
Recommendations for Energy Doses for Defibrillation in Cardiac Arrest
COR LOE Recommendations
2a C-LD
1. In infants and children experiencing cardiac arrest
with VF/pVT, it is reasonable to use an initial dose
of 2–4 J/kg of monophasic or biphasic energy for
```
defibrillation; for ease of teaching, it is reasonable
```
to use an initial dose of 2 J/kg.
2b C-LD
2. In infants and children experiencing cardiac arrest
with refractory VF/pVT, it may be reasonable to
attempt subsequent defibrillation doses of 4 J/kg
of monophasic or biphasic energy, and higher
levels may be considered, though not to exceed
10 J/kg or the adult maximum dose.
2b C-LD
3. In infants and children experiencing cardiac arrest
with refractory VF/pVT, a single defibrillation
dose of monophasic or biphasic energy may be
```
considered over sequential (stacked) shocks,
```
followed by resumption of chest compressions.
Synopsis
The proportion of cardiac arrests with initial VF/pVT
steadily increases throughout childhood into adolescence
yet remains lower than adults.1,2 In infants and children,
cardiac arrests due to an initial rhythm of VF/pVT have
better outcomes than cardiac arrests due to initial non-
shockable rhythms.3 In addition, development of VF/pVT
after the initiation of CPR for an initial nonshockable
```
rhythm (subsequent VF/pVT) is associated with worse
```
outcomes compared to patients in whom VF/pVT is the
initial pulseless rhythm.1 Timely defibrillation is the defini-
```
tive treatment for VF/pVT; and the shorter the duration of
```
VF/pVT before defibrillation, the more likely the shock will
result in a perfusing rhythm.3 Biphasic defibrillators require
lower energy to terminate VF/pVT and have fewer side
effects than monophasic defibrillators.4,5 Stacked shocks
```
(the delivery of a rapid series of sequential defibrillations
```
```
for VF/pVT via one set of pads) are associated with higher
```
```
rates of VF/pVT termination in some adult studies; how-
```
ever, this has not been well studied in pediatrics.6–9
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. A systematic review10 found insufficient data to
determine a relationship between optimal initial
energy dose and outcomes. An IHCA case series11
concluded that 2 J/kg was effective in terminating
the majority of VF, but neither subsequent rhythm
nor outcome was reported. An observational study of
IHCA12 showed a higher initial energy dose of ≥3 to
5 J/kg was less effective than 1 to 3 J/kg in achiev-
ing ROSC. One observational IHCA study13 did not
identify a specific initial energy dose associated with
successful VF/pVT termination, while another obser-
vational IHCA study14 found that 2 J/kg was an inef-
fective initial dose compared to higher dose ranges of
2.5 to 3 J/kg, especially for secondary VF. A registry
study of pediatric IHCA with initial VF/pVT evaluated
children who received energy doses <1.7 J/kg, 1.7
to 2.5 J/kg or >2.5 J/kg. They found that children
≤12 years of age who received initial energy doses of
<1.7 J/kg or >2.5 J/kg had lower rates of survival to
hospital discharge compared to those who received
1.7 to 2.5 J/kg. Furthermore, all children ≤18 years
of age who received initial energy doses of >2.5
J/kg for initial VF had lower survival rates compared
to those who received 1.7 to 2.5 J/kg.15
2. Two IHCA studies 13,14 suggest that defibrillation
doses >2 J/kg may be needed for subsequent
shocks to terminate VF. Human and animal studies
demonstrate higher defibrillation doses up to 10
J/kg can be provided without significant harm to
the myocardium. 14,16–21 Maximum energy doses as
```
recommended for adults (see “Part 9: Advanced
```
```
Life Support” recommendations on defibrillation 22)
```
may vary depending on monophasic versus bipha-
sic defibrillators as well as specific manufacturer
recommendations.23
3. There are limited data for the use of sequential
```
(stacked) shocks, where a series of rapid sequen-
```
tial defibrillations is provided without resumption
of compressions between shocks, for pediatric
VF/pVT.6,24–26 An IHCA study evaluating transtho-
racic impedance during defibrillation of children ≥8
years of age suggests that stacked shocks do not
improve defibrillation success.6 Notably, stacked
shocks lead to longer periods where chest com-
pressions are not being performed.

MEASURING CPR PHYSIOLOGY AND
QUALITY
Recommendations for Measuring CPR Physiology and Quality
COR LOE Recommendations
2a B-NR
1. For infants and children with continuous invasive
arterial blood pressure monitoring in place during
CPR, it is reasonable for health care professionals
to use diastolic blood pressure to assess the
child’s response to resuscitation efforts.
2b B-NR
2. For infants and children with invasive airways in
place during CPR, ETCO 2 monitoring may be
considered to monitor CPR quality.
2b C-LD
3. For infants and children with continuous invasive
arterial blood pressure monitoring in place
during CPR, it may be reasonable for health care
professionals to target a diastolic blood pressure
of ≥25 mm Hg in infants and ≥30 mm Hg in
children ≥1 y of age.
2b C-LD
4. The usefulness of noninvasive cerebral
oxygenation monitoring via near-infrared
spectroscopy during CPR in infants and children
is not well established.
2b C-EO
5. It may be reasonable for the rescuer to use
CPR feedback devices in infants and children to
optimize adequate chest compression rate and
depth as part of a continuous resuscitation quality
improvement system.
2b C-EO
6. When appropriately trained personnel are
available, echocardiography may be considered
to identify potentially treatable causes of cardiac
arrest in infants and children, such as cardiac
tamponade and inadequate ventricular filling,
but the potential benefits should be weighed
against the known deleterious consequences of
interrupting chest compressions.
3:Harm C-LD
7. A specific ETCO2 cutoff value alone should not be
used as an indication to end resuscitative efforts in
infants and children.

Lasa et al Pediatric Advanced Life Support: 2025 AHA/AAP Guidelines for CPR and ECC
Synopsis
Initiating and maintaining high-quality CPR are asso-
ciated with improved rates of ROSC, survival to hos-
pital discharge, and favorable neurologic outcome, yet
measured CPR quality is often suboptimal. 1–3 Noninva-
sive and invasive monitoring techniques may be used
to assess CPR quality and the patient’s physiologic
response to resuscitation. Invasive arterial blood pres-
sure monitoring during CPR reveals compression and
medication-generated pressures. 4,5 ETCO 2 reflects both
the cardiac output produced and ventilation efficacy
and may provide feedback on the quality of CPR. 6 A
sudden rise in ETCO 2 may be an early sign of ROSC. 7
```
CPR feedback devices (ie, audio, and audiovisual de-
```
```
vices) may improve compression rate, depth, and recoil
```
within a system of training and quality assurance for
high-quality CPR. Point-of-care ultrasound during CPR,
specifically echocardiography, has been considered for
the identification of reversible causes of arrest. Tech-
nologies that are under evaluation to assess resuscita-
tion quality include noninvasive measures of cerebral
oxygenation, such as near-infrared spectroscopy, which
measures regional oxygen saturation and does not re-
quire pulsatile flow.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1 and 3. A multicenter observational study of children
with IHCA demonstrated superior outcomes
```
with higher diastolic blood pressure (≥25 mm
```
Hg in infants <1 year of age and ≥30 mm Hg
```
in older children ≥1 year of age) during the first
```
10 minutes of CPR.4 In a prospective multi-
center validation study in 413 children, these
thresholds were associated with higher rela-
```
tive risk of ROSC (adjusted relative risk 1.49;
```
```
1.13–1.97) and survival to hospital discharge
```
```
(adjusted relative risk 1.32; 1.01–1.74).8,9 A
```
secondary analysis of the same trial observed
that patients who had an increase of ≥5 mm
Hg in diastolic blood pressure in response to
the first dose of epinephrine had higher rates
of ROSC.5 Clinical data regarding the efficacy
or appropriate means of prospectively target-
ing diastolic blood pressure during CPR are
lacking.
2. Higher ETCO 2 values during CPR are associ-
ated with ROSC.10,11 A previous multicenter
study of 43 children with IHCA did not iden-
tify an association between mean ETCO2 and
survival outcomes.12 However, a recent pro-
spective multicenter study in 234 children
evaluated average ETCO 2 during the first 10
minutes of in-hospital CPR.13 On multivariable
analysis, ETCO2 ≥20 mm Hg was associated
with higher odds of ROSC and survival to dis-
charge and higher intra-arrest blood pressures,
but not CPR quality metrics. A single-center
study found that higher median event ETCO2
was associated with markers of high-quality
CPR—chest compression rate less than 140
```
compressions per minute (P <0.0001) and
```
chest compression fractions of 90% to 100%
```
(P <0.0001).11
```
4. One small single-center study of cerebral near-
```
infrared spectroscopy (n=23) monitored dur-
```
ing pediatric cardiac arrest demonstrated that
higher median regional cerebral oxygen satura-
tion during the overall CPR event and in the last
5 minutes of CPR was associated with higher
rates of ROSC, but not survival to discharge. 14
A multicenter study of 92 pediatric patients at
3 sites demonstrated an association between a
higher median event regional cerebral oxygen
saturation and ROSC, survival to hospital dis-
charge, and survival with favorable neurologic
outcome.15
5. A simulation trial of pediatric health care pro-
fessionals demonstrated a significant improve-
ment in chest compression depth and rate
compliance when they received visual feed-
```
back (compared to no feedback), although
```
overall compression quality remained poor. 16
One small observational study of 8 children
with IHCA did not find an association between
CPR with or without audiovisual feedback
and survival to discharge, although feedback
decreased excessive compression rates.17
6. Several case series have evaluated the
use of bedside echocardiography during
pediatric cardiac arrest to identify revers-
ible causes of cardiac arrest and potentially
direct management. However, data are very
limited and the utility of echocardiography to
direct care during pediatric CPR is unknown.
Potential risks of echocardiography during
CPR include prolonged interruptions in chest
compressions. 18–20
7. A single-center study found that 42% of
infants and children with a median event
ETCO 2 <20 mm Hg achieved ROSC. 11 A
prospective, multicenter study of ETCO 2 dur-
ing the first 10 minutes of CPR found that
47.5% of infants and children with ETCO 2
<20 mm Hg and 47.6% of those with ETCO 2
<10 mm Hg survived to hospital discharge. 13
Given these variable associations between
low ETCO 2 values during CPR and survival
outcomes, there is potential harm in making
termination of resuscitation decisions based
on ETCO 2 alone. 13,21

Recommendation for the Use of Extracorporeal Cardiopulmonary
Resuscitation
COR LOE Recommendation
2b C-LD
1. ECPR may be considered for infants and children
with IHCA refractory to conventional CPR in
selected populations in clinical settings with
ECPR protocols and expertise.
Synopsis
ECPR is the rapid deployment of venoarterial ECMO
for refractory cardiac arrest. This has been defined as
the initiation of ECMO flow during active CPR or with-
in 20 minutes of ROSC. 1 The deployment of ECPR by
resourced and highly trained health care teams is as-
sociated with improved survival outcomes compared to
conventional CPR in specific IHCA patient populations
with reversible causes. 2,3 Pediatric patients with underly-
ing cardiac disease continue to represent a population
of patients with improved survival to hospital discharge
and good neurologic outcomes following deployment of

ECPR systems of care.9
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. Two single-center, retrospective case series of
ECPR in patients with preexisting cardiac disease
showed rates of survival to hospital discharge
of 43.8% to 48%, and of survivors, 68% to 75%
survived with a favorable neurologic outcome. 10,11
Similar findings were reported in 5 additional sin-
gle/multicenter studies among patients across
illness classifications, with the majority in the car-
diac illness category.12–16 A retrospective multi-
center study of cardiac ICU patients from a quality
improvement registry showed higher survival to
discharge of ECPR recipients with cardiac surgi-
cal disease compared to cardiac medical disease,3
while analysis of 2 registries showed noncardiac
diagnoses were associated with an increased risk
of death following ECPR.17 A retrospective analysis
from an inpatient pediatric database showed no dif-
ference in mortality between patients who received
conventional CPR and patients who received
ECPR, the majority of whom were cardiac surgery
patients.18 Another retrospective analysis using a
national registry showed higher rates of survival
with ECPR in cardiac surgical patients who had a
cardiac arrest. 5 For noncardiac populations experi-
encing IHCA, a retrospective study from a national
database found no difference in survival to hospital
discharge between ECPR and conventional CPR.8
Additional data evaluating the use of ECPR in non-
cardiac patients or those who experience OHCA is
insufficient to make a recommendation at this time.

1. For infants and children who remain comatose
following cardiac arrest, continuous central
temperature monitoring is recommended.

2. For infants and children who remain comatose
following cardiac arrest, avoiding central
temperatures >37.5 °C is recommended.
2a B-R
3. For infants and children between 24 h and 18 y of
age who remain comatose after IHCA or OHCA,
it is reasonable to use a 5-d course of targeted

°C followed by TTM of 36 °C–37.5 °C, or only
TTM of 36 °C–37.5 °C.
Synopsis
Hypoxic ischemic brain injury is a leading cause of
morbidity and mortality following pediatric cardiac ar-
rest. Hypoxic ischemic brain injury leads to free radical
production, cellular apoptosis and necrosis.1 Primary
and secondary brain injury can result in cerebral isch-
emia or hyperemia, encephalopathy, seizures, and cere-
bral edema. Fever is common post–cardiac arrest and
is associated with worse neurologic outcomes. Fever is
also associated with increased central nervous system
metabolic demands which may exacerbate primary brain
injury after arrest.2,3 Targeted temperature management
```
(TTM) refers to actively maintaining a patient’s tempera-
```
ture within a closely prescribed temperature range while
continuously monitoring central temperature. All forms of
TTM actively prevent fever. Maintaining TTM between 32
°C and 34 °C attempts to treat systemic ischemic re-
perfusion injury.4,5 A systematic review of pooled animal
studies comparing TTM between 32 °C and 36 °C to
control groups showed a strong effect of TTM on favor-
able neurologic outcome and reduced mortality. 6
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. Accurate measurement of temperature is most reli-
```
ably obtained at a core site (eg, rectal, esophageal,
```
```
or bladder). Continuous temperature monitoring
```
assesses temperature swings in patients at high
risk for temperature instability. Continuous core
temperature monitoring was used for the 5 days
of TTM in Therapeutic Hypothermia After Pediatric
```
Cardiac Arrest (THAPCA) trials.7,8
```
2. Hyperthermia in the post–cardiac arrest period is
common3 and is associated with decreased survival
from both IHCA and OHCA. Avoiding hyperther-
mia offers a potential means to improve neurologic
outcome. 9–11 Effective prevention of fever has been
shown with active cooling with servo-regulated
devices compared to air-cooled devices or passive
cooling techniques12 and with adoption of lower
target temperature. 13
3. The THAPCA randomized clinical trials of TTM
```
(32 °C–34 °C for 48 hours followed by 3 days of
```
TTM 36 °C–37.5 °C versus TTM 36 °C–37.5 °C
```
for a total of 5 days) after IHCA or OHCA in chil-
```
dren with coma following ROSC found no differ-
ence in 1-year survival with a favorable neurologic
outcome.7,8 Secondary analyses of the THAPCA
trials showed no difference between temperature
groups in any of the following subgroups: ECMO or
ECPR, hypotension post-ROSC, open chest resus-
citation, combined cohort of IHCA and OHCA, and
acute kidney injury. 14–19 A Bayesian reanalysis of
the THAPCA-OH trial found a high probability that
hypothermia provides a modest benefit in neurobe-
havioral outcome and survival at 1 year. 20 A recent
retrospective observational study found that chil-
dren who received TTM 33 °C per clinician deci-
sion had higher health-related quality of life scores
versus those who received TTM 36 °C evaluated at
3 years after the cardiac arrest.21

continuous arterial pressure monitoring is
recommended to identify and treat hypotension
when appropriate resources are available.
Synopsis

Hypotension (<fifth percentile for age and sex) is com-

25% to 50% of infants and children. 15,22 In addition to
the primary causes of cardiac arrest, hypotension can
be related to myocardial dysfunction and systemic re-
perfusion, which is associated with inflammation and
vasoplegia. Hypotension can exacerbate brain ischemia
and myocardial ischemic injury, systemic hypoperfusion
and resultant tissue hypoxia. Myocardial dysfunction,
which is often present regardless of arrest etiology,
typically occurs within hours of arrest and resolves in
48 to 72 hours. 23 Both the presence and severity of
postarrest hypotension are associated with lower rates
of survival to discharge. 15,22,24 whereas normal or high
blood pressures are associated with survival to dis-

1 and 2. Blood pressure is often labile in the post–car-
diac arrest period and recognition of hypoten-
sion is important. Continuous blood pressure
monitoring allows for rapid identification of
hypotension and can facilitate immediate treat-
ment. Two observational studies associated
systolic blood pressure below the fifth per-
centile for age in the first 12 hours following
cardiac arrest with decreased rates of survival
to discharge.15,22 The severity and duration of
systolic hypotension within the first 72 hours
post–cardiac arrest care in the pediatric ICU
```
(PICU) are associated with decreased survival
```
to discharge, 24 whereas the combined absence
of both post–cardiac arrest systolic hypoten-
sion and fever was associated with increased
odds of survival to discharge.13 A secondary
analysis of the ICU-Resuscitation trial of pedi-
atric IHCA found higher rates of survival to
hospital discharge as well as survival to hos-
pital discharge with favorable neurologic out-
come when blood pressure targets were above
a threshold of systolic blood pressure >10th
percentile for age and diastolic blood pres-
sure >50th percentile for age during the first
6 hours post–cardiac arrest. 26 A multicenter
study of IHCA and OHCA found that mean
arterial blood pressure between the fifth and
74th percentiles for age was associated with
favorable neurologic outcome.27 An additional
study showed that mean arterial blood pres-
sure <10th percentile for age in the first 24
hours after cardiac arrest, quantified as bur-
```
den of hypotension (duration and magnitude),

was associated with unfavorable neurologic
outcomes.28

Synopsis
Post–cardiac arrest care is a critical component of the
Chain of Survival. Monitoring of gas exchange with
oxygen and ventilation titration is a key component of
post–cardiac arrest care with the goal of preventing
secondary end-organ injury. Although current recom-
mendations are to administer 100% oxygen during
cardiac arrest to maximize oxygenation during CPR
as well as to minimize hypoxic-ischemic injury, 29 tar-
get ranges for post-ROC oxygenation are less certain.
Animal studies 30,31 have shown associations with hy-
peroxia and reactive oxygen species, inflammation and
brain injury, yet observational studies in infants and
```
children post-ROC (whether spontaneous or achieved
```
```
by mechanical means) have demonstrated mixed as-
```
sociations for hyperoxemia with survival and neurologic
outcomes. 32–36 While most studies demonstrated ad-
verse outcomes with hypoxemia, 1 recent observation-
al study did not find an association with hypoxemia in
the post–cardiac arrest period. 37 Associations of either
duration or severity of hypoxemia or hyperoxemia with
adverse outcomes in the post–cardiac arrest setting
are unknown.
Extremes of arterial carbon dioxide levels lead to
```
cerebral vasoconstriction when low (hypocapnia) and
```
```
vasodilation when high (hypercapnia).38 Carbon dioxide
```
level fluctuations and their impact on cerebral blood flow
in the pediatric post–cardiac arrest population remains
poorly understood, although emerging evidence sug-
gests mild hypercapnia may be associated with survival
and favorable neurologic outcome. 35,37

1 and 2. Because an arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation
of 100% may correspond to a Pao2 between
approximately 80 mm Hg and 500 mm Hg, it
is reasonable to target an oxyhemoglobin satu-
ration between 94% and 99%. Of note, pulse
oximeters may overestimate oxygen satura-
tion levels in patients with darker skin, which
```
can lead to lower oxygen levels (hypoxemia)

going undetected.39,40 Six small observational
studies of pediatric IHCA and OHCA did not

COR LOE Recommendations

electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring is
```
recommended for the detection of seizures
after cardiac arrest in infants and children with
persistent encephalopathy.

2a C-EO
3. It is reasonable to treat nonconvulsive status
epilepticus after cardiac arrest in infants and
children in consultation with experts.
Synopsis
Post–cardiac arrest brain injury remains a leading cause
of morbidity and mortality in children because the brain
has limited tolerance of ischemia, hyperemia, or edema.
Post–cardiac arrest seizures occur in 5% to 30% of
patients and can be nonconvulsive, which can only be
detected on electroencephalography.44,45 Post–cardiac
arrest status epilepticus is associated with worse out-
comes, including death and neurologic injury in survivors.
There are no pediatric studies assessing the efficacy of
antiseizure medications for either prophylaxis or treat-
ment of seizures and their association with outcomes
such as survival to hospital discharge or survival with fa-
vorable neurologic outcome.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. Nonconvulsive seizures and nonconvulsive sta-
tus epilepticus are common after pediatric
cardiac arrest and are associated with worse out-
comes.44–47 The American Clinical Neurophysiology
Society recommends continuous EEG monitoring
for encephalopathic patients after pediatric cardiac
arrest.48 Nonconvulsive seizures and nonconvulsive
status epilepticus cannot be detected without EEG
monitoring.48
2 and 3. There is insufficient evidence to determine
whether treatment of convulsive or noncon-
vulsive seizures improves neurologic or func-
tional outcomes after pediatric cardiac arrest.
Both convulsive and nonconvulsive status epi-
lepticus are associated with worse outcomes,
but no study has evaluated treatment with
antiseizure medications compared to no treat-
ment.44,45 A study comparing treatment to no
treatment of rhythmic and periodic discharges
following adult cardiac arrest found no differ-
ence in survival or neurologic outcomes. 49 The
Neurocritical Care Society recommends treat-
ing status epilepticus with the goal of stopping
convulsive and electrographic seizure activity. 50

care.

NEUROLOGICAL PROGNOSTICATION
FOLLOWING CARDIAC ARREST
Introduction
Hypoxic ischemic brain injury is the leading cause of
death and disability after cardiac arrest.1 Early and reliable
neurological prognostication after resuscitation from pe-
diatric cardiac arrest is essential to guide treatment, en-
able accurate counseling, and provide family support. In
addition, accurate neurological prognostication is critical
to avoid inappropriate withdrawal of life-sustaining thera-
py in patients who may have a meaningful recovery while
also avoiding potentially inappropriate life-sustaining
treatments. For further discussion of ethical consider-
ations regarding prognostication and uncertainty, refer to
“Part 3: Ethics.”2
The definitions of favorable and unfavorable neuro-
logical outcome are complex and dynamic throughout
the recovery period after cardiac arrest. Recovery pro-
gresses along a temporal continuum such that a child
assessed as having a favorable or unfavorable outcome
at hospital discharge may be assessed differently sev-
eral months to years after discharge. Gross scoring sys-
tems such as the PCPC are limited in the granularity of
assessment and not standardized across ages, such that
the same PCPC of a 6-month-old and 10-year-old may
not be comparable. Thus, when classifying patients into
favorable versus unfavorable outcome categories and
combining timepoints of assessment, it is important to
understand that these dichotomous outcomes may not
give a complete picture of the individual patient’s com-
plex reality. However incomplete the portrait of outcomes,
health care professionals must still provide guidance to
families, thereby necessitating criteria to classify patient
outcomes.
These 2025 recommendations are based on 2
ILCOR systematic reviews of potential prognostic
```
modalities for neurological outcome; one for prediction
```
```
of good (favorable) neurological outcome and one for
```
```
prediction of poor (unfavorable) neurological outcome. 3,4
```
These reviews used the same data but analyzed them
```
differently based on the outcome being assessed (good
```
```
or poor). Definitions of good neurological outcome are
```
not standardized and vary across studies, most often
```
defined as a PCPC of 1 or 2; 1, 2, or 3; no change from
```
```
baseline; or a Vineland Adaptive Behavioral Score of
```
>70. 5,6
Good neurological outcome was assessed as a
```
threshold false positive rate (FPR) of less than 30%
```
```
(ie, predicting a good neurological outcome but having
```
```
a poor neurological outcome). 3,7 For poor neurological
```
```
outcome, they used an FPR of <1% (ie, predicting a
```
poor neurological outcome but having a good neuro-
```
logical outcome). 4 Sensitivity (eg, probability of a good
```
neurological outcome in a patient who has a positive
```
finding) was assessed for all studies but was not the
```
primary assessment of predictive accuracy. An FPR of
<1% was selected for predictors of poor neurological
outcome to minimize the risk of making recommenda-
tions for limitation of care in patients who would have
a good neurological outcome. Adult studies have used
FPR thresholds to predict poor neurological outcome
between <0% and 5%. 8,9 Standard thresholds to pre-
dict outcome from pediatric cardiac arrest have not been
established.
```
The systematic review for predicting good (favorable)
```
neurological outcome-assessed associations of posi-
```
tive test findings (eg, bilateral reactive pupils) with good
```
neurological outcome, whereas the systematic review
for poor neurological outcome-assessed associations
```
of negative findings (eg, bilateral unreactive pupils) with
```
poor neurological outcome. It cannot be presumed that
```
positive findings for favorable outcome (ie, presence of
```
```
reactive pupils with good neurological outcome) will have
```
the same predictive value as negative findings for unfa-
```
vorable neurological outcome (ie, absence of reactive
```
```
pupils with poor neurological outcome). For the purposes
```
of this guideline, we have chosen the terms favorable
```
(good) and unfavorable (poor).

Synopsis
Health care professionals use various assessments to
guide neurological prognostication in the post–cardiac
arrest period including neurological examination, bio-
```
markers, EEG, and neurological imaging modalities (eg,
```
brain computed tomography and magnetic resonance
```
imaging). Studies reporting the predictive accuracy
```
of individual assessments must be interpreted in the
context of timing following ROC, outcome assessed
```
(ie, survival versus survival with a good functional out-
```
```
come), and unmeasured confounders (eg, sedation).
```
Some modalities can predict favorable neurological
outcome, unfavorable neurological outcome, or both.
Each must be considered in conjunction with other
modalities.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. Numerous studies demonstrate associations
between clinical examination findings, biomarkers,
electrophysiology patterns, and neurological imag-
ing findings with outcomes following pediatric car-
diac arrest.10–22 However, these studies are limited
by their retrospective designs, lack of blinding, and
unadjusted and unmeasured confounding. In addi-
tion, there are no established predictive accuracy
```
thresholds (eg, sensitivity, specificity, Area Under
```
```
the Receiver Operating Curve) for individual or com-
```
bined criteria. Thus, multiple modalities are needed
for neurological prognostication.

Synopsis
Neurologic assessments routinely include brainstem re-
flexes such as pupillary response, cough and gag, and
motor response to stimuli. The neurologic examination
evolves in the days after cardiac arrest, and a given find-
```
ing (eg, pupillary reactivity) at an early timepoint may not
```
have the same accuracy for prediction of outcome at a
later timepoint. Furthermore, the predictive accuracy of
```
an exam finding (eg, pupillary reflexes) at one timepoint
```
for favorable neurological outcome may not have the
opposite predictive accuracy when the exam finding is
```
absent (eg, absence of pupillary reflexes for unfavorable
```
```
neurological outcome). Exam findings in these studies
```
are often obtained through retrospective chart review,
thus patient condition and potential confounders may not

1. Three studies assessed the associations between
cough or gag reflexes or evoked pain response and
neurological outcome. The presence of cough and
gag reflex at 24 hours predicted favorable neuro-
logical outcome with a low sensitivity of 40% for both

absence of cough and gag predicted an unfavorable

limited to 1 small single-center study and require
further evaluation.25

but only 1 study assessed each timepoint and

4. Three studies evaluating the presence of bilateral
pupillary reflexes within 12 hours of ROC dem-
```
onstrated a sensitivity (ie, probability of patients

with a favorable neurological outcome having
```
bilateral pupillary response) of at least 82% for

favorable neurological outcome (PCPC 1–2 or

an unfavorable neurological outcome) of 16% to

31%. 22,25,27 At timepoints >24 hours from ROC,
while sensitivity of bilateral pupillary reactivity was
75% to 100%, a high FPR of 68% was observed
thus demonstrating its lack of reliability for pre-
diction. 23–25,28–30 Therefore, findings of bilateral
pupillary reactivity >24 hours post–cardiac arrest
are less reliable and pupillary response alone is
inadequate for neurological prognostication at any
timepoint.
5. Three studies evaluated the absence of pupil-
lary reflexes to predict unfavorable neurologi-
cal outcome at 48 and 72 hours after ROC with
an FPR <1% but with wide confidence intervals
```
(95% CI, 0%–40%) and low sensitivity of 12% to

46%.24,25,31 These FPRs met the prespecified FPR
threshold and are moderately reliable, but should
only be used in conjunction with other predictors.
6. Six of 7 studies that assessed the absence of
bilateral pupillary reflexes to predict unfavorable
neurological outcome between <1 hour and 24
hours after ROC had an FPR >10% up to 60%
with sensitivities of 33% to 93%. 23,25,27–30 These
studies show that the absence of pupillary reflex
within 24 hours after ROC are not accurate to pre-

7. Three studies including 296 patients assessed
the association of mental status measured by the
total GCS or GCS motor score within 24 hours
of ROC with neurological outcome at ICU or hos-
pital discharge or 6 month follow-up. 26–28 A GCS
motor score of <4 at 1 hour after ROC to predict
unfavorable neurological outcome had high FPRs
of 83% and 50%, respectively, with high sensitivi-
ties of 93% to 94%. 27 A total GCS score of <4 at
resuscitation or within 1 hour of ROC predicted
unfavorable neurological outcome with a high
FPR of 70% and a high sensitivity of 86%. 26 A
total GCS score <7 to predict unfavorable neu-

high sensitivity of 92%. 28 These data demonstrate
that these GCS data are not accurate to predict
outcome.

Synopsis
Serum biomarkers are blood-based tests that measure
levels of proteins that are found in the central nervous
system or measure inflammation or systemic ischemic
reperfusion. Central nervous system proteins are re-
leased across the blood brain barrier when the brain is
```
injured: Neuron-specific enolase is released from injured
```
neurons, glial fibrillary acidic protein from injured glia,
neurofilament light from injured axons, and S100B from
injured astrocytes. Hypoxic ischemic brain injury and re-
perfusion injury may cause injury to these cells different-
ly, and release of these proteins may occur and peak at
different times after injury. Studies of these neuronal bio-
markers are limited by different assessment platforms,
different baseline values across platforms and extracere-
bral sources for some proteins.
Commonly measured blood-based markers of
inflammation or systemic ischemic reperfusion are pH
and lactate levels. Lactate levels may reflect the sever-
ity of systemic hypoxia and ischemia before, during, or
after cardiac arrest. pH is impacted by both systemic
acidosis, of which lactate acidosis may be a major con-
tributor, as well as respiratory acidosis, which may be
due to inadequate ventilation. These systemic markers
change over time after arrest. pH can be modified by
titration of the ventilator to correct respiratory acido-
sis as well as administration of sodium bicarbonate to

1. Serum lactate <2 mmol/L within 12 hours of ROC
had low sensitivity of 16% to 28% for favorable
neurological outcome, but a very low FPR rang-
ing from 4% to 7%. 33–35 Lactate thresholds of <2
mmol/L at 24 and 48 hours and <5 mmol/L at 1

come were low, there were no consistent thresh-
olds evaluated for these markers. Further study is
needed to validate specific biomarker thresholds
and discrete timepoints.

4. pH level was assessed in 4 studies. 20,34,35,39 A pH
threshold of >7.0 at 1 hour and 6 to 12 hours
post–cardiac arrest had high sensitivities of 71%

of >7.3 at 1 hour and 24 hours post–cardiac arrest
had sensitivities of 49% and 89% respectively but
FPRs of 38% and 81% respectively for favorable
neurological outcome.40 For unfavorable neurologi-

These systematic reviews assessed multiple EEG fea-

neurological outcomes.5,7
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. EEG monitoring up to 72 hours after ROC identifies
EEG background features and diagnoses electro-
graphic seizures. In patients who are encephalo-
pathic, clinical exams can be unreliable and seizures
can be subclinical. Electroencephalography is the
only way to identify subclinical seizures.21,22,30,42–46
2. Ten studies with more than 560 patients evaluated
the association of either continuous or routine
```
(brief) EEG at either <1 hour; 6 to 12 hours; 24,
```
```
48, 72 hours; or 4 to 6 days with favorable neuro-
```
logical outcome at PICU or hospital discharge or 6
months following cardiac arrest. Among the studies
evaluating EEG performed at 6 to 12 and 24 hours
post-ROC, 6 of 7 studies had FPRs less than 29%
for favorable neurological outcome with sensitivi-
ties that ranged from 7% to 100%.23,30,42,44,45,47,48
Studies at 48 and 72 hours reported FPRs ranging
from 0% to 50% for favorable neurological out-
come, although 50% of the studied timepoints had
FPRs less than 30%.21,24,29,47
3. The presence of sleep architecture at 6 to 12
hours or sleep spindles at 24 hours had an FPR of
16% and 8% for favorable neurological outcome,
with sensitivities of 57% and 80%, respectively.
Sleep spindles or sleep II architecture should not
be used as the sole assessment to prognosticate
at any timepoint.23,30
4. At 6 to 12 and 24 hours post-ROC, the presence
of reactivity had an FPR of less than 27% with a
sensitivity of 53% to 63% for favorable neurologi-
cal outcome. 42,44 At 48 hours, 1 study had an FPR
of 50%.44 Thus EEG reactivity, based on these data,
is accurate only at 6 to 24 hours, not 48 hours for
favorable neurological outcome.
5. The presence of status epilepticus predicted unfa-
vorable neurological outcomes with a low FPR of
0% at 24 to 72 hours after ROC in 3 studies,21,24,48
but an FPR of 4% to 5% at 4 to 6 hours and 6
to 12 hours, all with low sensitivity. 42,45 Thus, the
presence of status epilepticus at 24 to 72 hours
is moderately predictive for unfavorable neurologi-
cal outcome. The presence of burst suppression,
burst attenuation or generalized periodic epilepti-
form discharges within 24 hours of ROC had an
FPR that ranged from 0% to 19% and sensitivity
of 9% to 30% for unfavorable neurological out-
come.23,44,45,49 From 48 to 72 hours after ROC, 3

unfavorable neurological outcome.21,22,24 The pre-
diction of unfavorable neurological outcome was
moderately reliable from 24 to 72 hours.
6. Two studies of 61 patients, of which 8 had myo-
```
clonic status epilepticus, had an FPR of 0% (95%

CI, 0%–34%) and sensitivity of 17% to 21% at

PICU/hospital discharge.22,44 The presence of
attenuated, isoelectric, or flat EEG before 24
hours in 5 studies had FPRs ranging from 6% to
95%, 23,42,45,47,49 except for 2 studies that had and
FPR of 0% with upper limit confidence intervals
of 4% to 31%.30,50 In 6 studies from 48 hours to 7

```
from 3% to 71%.21,29,47,51 There are conflicted data
and further study is needed.
7. Of 10 studies, the presence of seizures between 4
to 6 hours and 24 hours post-ROC had an FPR of
0% to 20%, of which only 1 had an FPR of <1%
with wide confidence intervals44,45,50 and a sensitiv-
ity of 2% to 38% for predicting unfavorable neu-
rological outcome.27,30,34,42,44,45,48–50 At 48 hours and
onward only 2 studies reported an FPR for pre-
```
dicting unfavorable outcome of <1% 41,44; others
```
had FPRs up to 58%. The presence of seizures
is accurate to predict unfavorable neurologic out-
come at any of these timepoints. The absence of

Synopsis
Early neuroimaging after cardiac arrest is useful to de-
tect structural brain injury and potential etiologies of car-
diac arrest that may be amenable to intervention such as
evacuation of intracranial hemorrhage. MRI can assess
the severity of cytotoxic injury through diffusion weighted
imaging. Ischemic injury on diffusion weighted imaging
peaks at days 3 to 7 after cardiac arrest and may have
the appearance of normalizing, or “pseudonormalization,”
```
2 weeks after injury. Both computed tomography (CT)
```
and MRI findings evolve over the days after cardiac ar-
rest and must be interpreted in the context of other find-
ings and based on time from injury. Studies assessing
neuroimaging for the prediction of neurological outcome
require careful interpretation as they are limited by ret-
rospective designs where health care professionals have
likely used imaging results to guide treatment decisions.

POST–CARDIAC ARREST RECOVERY AND
SURVIVORSHIP
Recommendations for Post–Cardiac Arrest Recovery and Survivorship
COR LOE Recommendations
1 C-LD
1. It is recommended that infants and children
who survive cardiac arrest be evaluated for
rehabilitation services.
2a B-NR
2. It is reasonable that infants and children who
survive cardiac arrest be evaluated for physical,
cognitive, and emotional needs to guide follow-up
care within the first year following cardiac arrest.
Synopsis
Survivors of both in-hospital and out-of-hospital cardiac
arrest are at significant risk for both short-term and long-
term physical, neurological, cognitive, emotional, and so-
cial morbidities.1–3 Children who survive a cardiac arrest
with a grossly favorable outcome on the PCPC scale
may have more subtle and sustained neuropsychological
impairment.4 The full impact of brain injury on children’s
development may not be fully appreciated until months
to years after the cardiac arrest and discharge outcome
does not necessarily predict long-term outcome, as some
survivors with unfavorable outcome improve and others
with favorable outcome at discharge worsen over time.5
Recovery and Survivorship is the sixth ring in the Chain
of Survival and acknowledges that survivors of cardiac ar-
rest may require ongoing integrated medical, rehabilita-
tive, caregiver, and community support in the months to
```
years after their cardiac arrest (see Figure 5).6 The overall
```
societal burden of pediatric OHCA was assessed from

2016 to 2020, in terms of disability-adjusted life years
as a common public health metric to estimate burden of
disease, placing nontraumatic OHCA as 1 of the top 10
leading causes of annual disability-adjusted life years.7
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. Two randomized controlled trials of TTM for coma-
tose children after IHCA or OHCA, with a primary
outcome of favorable neurobehavioral function
defined by the Vineland Adaptive Behavioral Score
at 1 year post–cardiac arrest, showed that new
morbidity in survivors is common.8,9 Many children
who survived to 1 year with a favorable neurobe-
havioral outcome on Vineland Adaptive Behavior
Scales-II had global cognitive impairment or selec-
tive neuropsychological deficits.10
2. Recent statements from the AHA highlight the
importance of follow-up after discharge.1,11 Several
case series of pediatric cardiac arrest outcomes
at greater than 1 year post–cardiac arrest demon-
strate ongoing cognitive, physical, and neuropsy-
chological impairments.2–5 Longitudinal follow-up
studies up to 5 years after cardiac arrest identified
cognitive and behavioral deficits in pediatric survi-
vors who had absent or minimal neurologic change
from prearrest baseline at hospital discharge.5,10
Compared to healthy controls, survivors of cardiac
arrest have specific cognitive deficits correlated
with structural brain abnormalities demonstrated
on MRI. 12 Patients discharged with functional
impairments often face years of impaired function
and significant health care needs. The impact of
ongoing childhood development on recovery fol-
lowing pediatric cardiac arrest is unknown.

FAMILY PRESENCE DURING
RESUSCITATION
Recommendations for Family Presence During Resuscitation
COR LOE Recommendations
1 B-NR
1. Family members should be provided the option
of being present during the resuscitation of their
infant or child.
1 B-NR
2. When family members are present during
resuscitation of their infant or child, it is
recommended for a designated team member to
provide comfort, answer questions, and support
the family.
1 C-LD
3. If the presence of family members is considered
detrimental to the resuscitation of the infant or
child, family members should be respectfully asked
to leave.
Synopsis
The practice of allowing family presence during resuscita-
tion has become more common over the last 25 years.1
Parents may desire to be present during their child’s re-
suscitation to provide emotional support, share information
with the care team,2 and observe resuscitation measures.
Parental presence may offer a sense of involvement, re-
duce helplessness, and provide closure.3 Presence at their
child’s death can lead to lower rates of anxiety and de-
pression as well as improved grieving behaviors such as
social withdrawal and changes in activity levels.4,5
Health care professionals’ perspectives on family
presence differ significantly, but acceptance generally
rises with prior experience and among senior profession-
als.3 Parental presence can be encouraged by providing
parents with adequate support and consistent updates
throughout the resuscitation process, benefiting both the
family and the health care team. While health care profes-
sionals often worry about the potential negative psycho-
logical effects on families, evidence suggests benefit for
families to be present during resuscitation of their child.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. A systematic review of qualitative survey-based
studies reported that 85% of parents surveyed
expressed a desire to be present during their
child’s resuscitation. 6 Additionally, parents of 272
children who underwent resuscitation perceived
benefits from their presence, such as reduced
anxiety and improved understanding and process-
ing of the event.6 The presence of family members
can enhance parental satisfaction with the care
provided, provide families with a greater sense of
control,7 and improve self-reported adjustment to
the loss of their child. 3,8 Additionally, parent surveys
indicated a strong desire to be present to under-
stand what was happening, ensure that all possible
measures were being taken, and maintain physi-
cal contact with their child. 3,9,10 Not all parents who
have witnessed their child’s resuscitation would
choose to do so again. 11 While concerns have been
raised regarding family presence during resus-
citation including potential trauma for the family,
interference with procedures, effects on techni-
cal performance, and challenges for teaching and
clinical decision-making, these concerns have not
been substantiated by current evidence.7,12–14

2. The presence of a facilitator to support families is
beneficial and helps reduce stress. 15–19 One study
reported that 72% of health care professionals
support the use of a dedicated staff member for
this role during resuscitation.20 A systematic review
emphasized the significance of family facilitators in
providing emotional support and reducing parental
anxiety during resuscitation.21 Team members serv-
ing as communication liaisons have been reported
to update families in real-time, explain medical ter-
minology, and ensure effective two-way communi-
cation. Both parents and health care professionals
emphasized the importance of training personnel
to support family presence.22,23 A qualitative study
highlighted essential competencies for facilitators,
such as the ability to provide active listening, foster
partnership, and facilitate communication between
the family and resuscitation team leader. 20 In addi-
tion, 2 systematic reviews showed that parents
often seek spiritual and cultural comfort during
pediatric resuscitations. 19,21 Including spiritual
health care professionals/chaplains can help align
clinical care with families’ needs, enhance the
emotional safety of resuscitations, and support
long-term healing. 24 While having a dedicated team
member to support families during resuscitations
can help in the processing of traumatic events,
this may not always be feasible, and the absence
of such a team member does not preclude family
presence during resuscitation.
3. Most surveys suggest that family presence dur-
ing resuscitation is not disruptive, although some
health care professionals report increased stress.25
Health care professionals with extensive experi-
ence in family presence recognize that occasional
negative experiences may occur.26 Concerns have
been raised by both health care professionals and
family members that parental presence during
resuscitation may be distracting and could impact
the resuscitation. Health care professionals, in par-
ticular, often worry about the risk of litigation and
the potential negative psychological effects on fam-
ilies.3,7 One randomized trial found that witnessed
resuscitation increased health care professionals’
anxiety yet reduced anxiety in family members. 27
In randomized controlled simulation studies, fam-
ily presence did not affect hands-on time or CPR
quality, but led to increased frustration, perceived
temporal demands, and mental demands on health
care professionals.28,29

EVALUATION OF SUDDEN UNEXPLAINED
CARDIAC ARREST
Recommendations for the Evaluation of Sudden Unexplained Cardiac
Arrest
COR LOE Recommendations
1 B-NR
1. A complete unrestricted autopsy of infants
and children with sudden unexplained death
is recommended, preferably performed by a
pathologist with training and experience in
cardiovascular pathology with preservation of
biological material for further genetic analysis
to determine the presence of inherited cardiac
disease.
1 B-NR
2. When conventional autopsy does not identify a
cause of death or diagnosis in infants and children
with sudden unexplained death, a postmortem
genetic evaluation is recommended, when
resources allow, especially if clinical evidence
suggests the diagnosis of an inherited cardiac
disease.
1 B-NR
3. When autopsy does not identify a cause of death
or is not performed in infants and children with
sudden unexplained death, it is recommended
that first-degree family members be referred to a
health care professional or center with expertise
in inherited cardiac disease and cardiac genetic
counseling.
1 C-EO
4. For infants and children who survive sudden
unexplained cardiac arrest, obtain a complete
```
past medical and family history (including a history
```
of syncopal episodes, seizures, unexplained
accidents or drowning, or sudden unexpected
```
death before 50 y of age), review previous
```
electrocardiograms, and refer to a cardiologist
with expertise in inherited cardiac disease.
Synopsis
```
Inherited cardiac diseases (ie, cardiomyopathies, chan-
```
```
nelopathies), and coronary artery anomalies are common
```
causes of sudden unexplained cardiac arrest in infants
and children. In patients who do not survive, autopsy
plays an essential role to correctly identify the etiology
of the cardiac arrest. Up to one third of young patients
who do not survive sudden unexplained cardiac arrest
have no abnormalities found on gross and microscopic
```
autopsies.1–4 Postmortem genetic evaluation (“molecu-
```
```
lar autopsy”) is increasingly used as an important tool to
```
evaluate potential causes of sudden unexplained death
and identify inheritable cardiac diseases.5 In addition to
providing an explanation, genetic diagnosis can enable
necessary screening and preventive measures for rela-
tives and survivors.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. Previous reviews and consensus guidelines state
the importance of an autopsy following sudden
unexplained cardiac death to aid in determining
the cause of death and to identify possible inher-
ited cardiac conditions. 6–9 An autopsy can identify
several causes of death in infants and children
with sudden unexplained cardiac death, includ-
```
ing cardiomyopathy (ie, hypertrophic, dilated, or
```
```
arrhythmogenic) and anomalous coronary arter-
```
ies. When no cause of death is identified on gross
examination, microscopic evaluation and pres-
ervation of biological tissue is paramount to be
able to perform a molecular autopsy if resources
allow.
2. Previous systematic reviews and consensus guide-
lines emphasize the use of postmortem genetic
testing for inherited cardiac causes of sudden
```
death (ie, cardiomyopathies, channelopathies).
```
A review reported up to 50% of sudden cardiac
death cases in infants and children had a poten-
tial genetic disease identified.7 In multiple studies,
genetic mutations causing channelopathies were
identified in 2% to 10% of infants with sudden
infant death syndrome.10–16 Among children with
sudden unexplained death and a normal autopsy,
9 cohort studies report identification of genetic
mutations associated with channelopathy or
cardiomyopathy. 14,17–24
3. In multiple studies, 13% to 53% of first- and
second-degree relatives of patients with unex-
plained cardiac arrest were diagnosed with inher-
ited cardiac disease after screening using medical
and family history, clinical exam, and laboratory
evaluation.7,17–20,25–32 A small case series suggested
that genetic screening of family members should
be directed by clinical history. 17
4. A retrospective study of 155 adult survivors of
nonischemic sudden cardiac arrest reported
49% of survivors were diagnosed with an inher-
ited cardiac condition. 27 Several cohort studies
report the utility of obtaining a complete past

Synopsis
Shock is the failure of oxygen delivery to meet tissue
metabolic demands and can be life threatening. The
most common type of pediatric shock is hypovolemic, in-
cluding hemorrhagic shock, with distributive, cardiogenic,
and obstructive shock occurring less frequently. Multiple
types of shock can occur simultaneously, and early pre-
```
sentations can be subtle; health care professionals must
```
be vigilant.
Shock progresses over a continuum of severity, from
```
a compensated to a decompensated (hypotensive) state.
```
Compensatory mechanisms include tachycardia and
increased systemic vascular resistance to maintain car-
diac output and end-organ perfusion. As compensatory
mechanisms fail, hypotension and signs of inadequate
end-organ perfusion develop, such as depressed mental
status, decreased urine output, acidosis, and weak cen-
tral pulses.
Sepsis is a life-threatening response to infection,
where the body’s immune system overreacts, leading to
widespread inflammation and organ dysfunction. Sep-
tic shock is characterized as sepsis with cardiovascu-
lar dysfunction including hypotension. Early recognition
```
and prompt treatment (eg, antibiotics, fluids) are critical
```
for improving outcomes in infants and children. Mortal-
ity from pediatric sepsis has declined, concurrent with
implementation of guidelines emphasizing early antibiotic
and fluid administration. 1 Controversies in septic shock
management include volume and type of fluid adminis-
tration, vasopressor timing and choice, and use of cor-
ticosteroids. Previous AHA guidelines 2 had considered
large studies of patients with malaria, sickle cell anemia,
```
and dengue shock syndrome; however, generalization of
```
results from these studies is problematic.
This topic was last reviewed in the 2020 AHA Guide-
lines for CPR and ECC. These recommendations have not
been updated for this edition of the Guidelines, with the
exception of No. 6, which was reviewed and updated. 3
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. Although fluids remain the mainstay initial therapy
for infants and children in shock, especially in
hypovolemic and septic shock, fluid overload can
lead to increased morbidity. 4 In 2 randomized trials
of patients with septic shock, those who received
higher fluid volumes 5 or faster fluid resuscitation 6
were more likely to develop clinically significant
fluid overload characterized by increased rates of
mechanical ventilation and worsening oxygenation.
2. In a systematic review, 12 relevant studies were
identified, though 11 assessed colloid or crystalloid
fluid resuscitation in patients with malaria, dengue
shock syndrome, or “febrile illness” in sub-Saharan
Africa.7 There was no clear benefit to crystalloid or
colloid solutions as first-line fluid therapy in any of
the identified studies.
3. One randomized controlled trial compared the use
```
of balanced (lactated Ringer’s solution) to unbal-
```
```
anced (0.9% saline) crystalloid solutions as the ini-
```
tial resuscitation fluid and showed no difference in
relevant clinical outcomes. 8 A matched retrospec-
tive cohort study of pediatric patients with septic
shock showed no difference in outcomes,9 though
a propensity-matched database study showed an
association with increased 72-hour mortality and
vasoactive infusion days with unbalanced crystal-
loid fluid resuscitation.10
4. In a small, randomized controlled study, there were
no significant differences in outcomes with the use
of 20 mL/kg as the initial fluid bolus volume in
```
septic shock, compared to 10 mL/kg; however, the
```
study was limited by a small sample size.5
5. Two pediatric randomized controlled trials compar-
ing escalating doses of dopamine or epinephrine
demonstrated improvement in timing of resolution
of septic shock11 and 28-day mortality12 with the
use of epinephrine over dopamine. Both studies
were conducted in resource-limited settings, and
the doses of inotropes used may not have been
directly comparable, limiting conclusions from the

studies. Medications that increase systemic vascu-
lar resistance, such as norepinephrine, may also be
a reasonable initial vasopressor therapy in septic
shock patients.1,13–15 International sepsis guidelines
recommend the choice of medications to be guided
by patient physiology and clinician preferences.1
6. No studies support deviations from standard life-
support algorithms to improve outcomes in patients
with sepsis-associated cardiac arrest. Sepsis-
associated cardiac arrest is associated with worse
outcomes than other causes of cardiac arrest.16
7. A meta-analysis17 showed no change in survival with
corticosteroid use in pediatric septic shock, though
a subsequent randomized controlled trial suggested
a shorter time to reversal of shock with steroid use.18
Two observational studies19,20 suggested there may
be specific subpopulations, based on genomics, that
would either benefit or experience harm from ste-
roid administration, though these subpopulations
are difficult to identify clinically. Patients at risk for
```
adrenal insufficiency (eg, those on chronic steroids,
```
```
patients with purpura fulminans) are more likely to
```
benefit from steroid therapy.14
8. In situations when epinephrine or norepinephrine
are not available, dopamine is a reasonable alter-
native initial vasoactive infusion in patients with
fluid-refractory septic shock.11,12 Patients with
vasodilatory shock may require a higher dose of
dopamine.13
Management of Cardiogenic Shock
Recommendations for Management of Cardiogenic Shock
COR LOE Recommendations
1 C-EO 1. For infants and children with cardiogenic shock,early expert consultation is recommended.
2b C-EO
2. For infants and children with cardiogenic
shock, it may be reasonable to use epinephrine,
dopamine, dobutamine, or milrinone as an
inotropic infusion.
Synopsis
Cardiogenic shock occurs when the heart is unable to
pump blood efficiently, resulting in decreased cardiac
output and inadequate oxygen delivery to tissues. While
it is relatively rare in children compared to other forms
of shock, it is associated with high rates of mortality.21
Causes of cardiogenic shock include congenital heart
disease, myocarditis, cardiomyopathies, and arrythmias.
Clinical manifestations vary by severity and underlying
cause. Initial compensatory mechanisms include tachy-
cardia, tachypnea, and increased systemic vascular re-
sistance. As compensatory mechanisms fail, hypotension
and signs of inadequate end-organ perfusion develop,
such as depressed mental status, decreased urine out-
put, lactic acidosis, and weak central pulses. Initial treat-
ment is focused on improving oxygen delivery, minimizing
oxygen consumption, and restoring cardiac function
through administration of vasoactive medications. It is
important to note that cardiogenic shock can occur with
other forms of shock simultaneously. In its early stages,
it can be difficult to diagnose, so a high index of sus-
picion is warranted. This topic was last reviewed in the
2020 AHA Guidelines for CPR and ECC. These recom-
mendations have not been updated for this edition of the
Guidelines.3
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1 and 2. Cardiogenic shock in infants and children is
uncommon and associated with high mortal-
ity rates. No studies were identified comparing
outcomes between vasoactive medications. For
patients with hypotension, vasoactive medica-
tions such as epinephrine may be more appro-
priate as an initial inotropic therapy. Because
of the rarity and complexity of these presen-
tations, expert consultation is recommended
when managing infants and children in cardio-
genic shock.
Management of Traumatic Hemorrhagic Shock
Recommendation for Management of Traumatic Hemorrhagic Shock
COR LOE Recommendation
2a C-EO
1. Among infants and children with hypotensive
hemorrhagic shock following trauma, it is
reasonable to administer blood products, when
available, instead of crystalloid for ongoing volume
resuscitation.
Synopsis
Resuscitation guidance for children with hemorrhagic
shock is evolving, as crystalloid-then-blood paradigms
are being challenged by resuscitation protocols using
blood products early in resuscitation. However, the ideal
resuscitation strategy for a given type of injury is often
unknown.
This topic was last reviewed in the 2020 AHA Guide-
lines for CPR and ECC. These recommendations have not
been updated for this edition of the Guidelines.3
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. There are no prospective pediatric data comparing
the administration of early blood products versus
early crystalloid for traumatic hemorrhagic shock. A
scoping review identified 6 retrospective studies that
compared patient outcomes with the total volume of
crystalloid resuscitation received in the first 24 to 48
hours among children with hemorrhagic shock.22–27
Four studies reported no differences in survival
to 24 hours, survival at 30 days with good neuro-
logical outcome, or survival to discharge.22,24–26,28

6 studies. 23–28 One study reported lower survival to
hospital discharge among children who received
more than 60 mL/kg crystalloid compared to lower
volume groups. 27 Despite limited pediatric data,
guidelines for adults from the Eastern Association
for the Surgery of Trauma, 29 the American College
of Surgeons, and the National Institute for Health
and Care Excellence30 suggest the early use of
balanced ratios of packed red blood cells, fresh
frozen plasma, and platelets for trauma-related
hemorrhagic shock.29 The American College of
Surgeons and the National Institute for Health and
Care Excellence 30 suggest the early use of bal-
anced ratios of packed red blood cells, fresh frozen
plasma, and platelets for trauma-related hemor-
rhagic shock.

INTUBATION
Use of Cuffed Endotracheal Tubes for
Intubation
Recommendations for the Use of Cuffed Endotracheal Tubes for
Intubation
COR LOE Recommendations
1 C-EO
1. When a cuffed endotracheal tube (ETT) is used
in infants and children, attention should be paid
to ETT size, position, and cuff inflation pressure
```
(usually <20–25 cm H 2O).
```
2a B-NR 2. It is reasonable to choose cuffed ETTs overuncuffed ETTs for intubating infants and children.
Synopsis
Cuffed and uncuffed ETTs have been studied in the
perioperative period and up to 48 hours postintuba-
tion. These studies have shown that cuffed ETTs are
safe in infants and children and are not associated with
significant differences in postextubation airway compli-
cations.1–6 The primary advantage of cuffed ETTs over
uncuffed tubes is a reduction in the need for ETT chang-
es, which reduces high-risk reintubations and interrup-
tions in chest compressions during CPR that may occur
during reintubation. Additional potential benefits include
improved capnography accuracy and a lower risk of atel-
ectasis. 2,5–13 Although several studies have identified that
cuffed tubes may decrease airway trauma by decreasing
tube exchanges, attention must be directed to selecting
the correct tube size3 and cuff inflation pressure.14 ETT
cuff pressures are dynamic during transport at altitude,15
and with increasing airway edema or pressure, make it
necessary to monitor the cuff pressure to avoid damage
to the airway mucosa.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. A retrospective study of 155 neonates and children
under 12 years of age undergoing cardiac surgery
with cardiopulmonary bypass and intubated for at
least 4 hours postoperatively found larger ETT size
as the only significant factor associated with air-
way complications.3 A retrospective study of 2953
children found that applying 25 cm H2 O of cuff
pressure with a slight leak around the ETT resulted
in no cases of clinically significant subglottic ste-
nosis and the incidence of reintubation for stridor
was less than 1%. 1
2. Three systematic reviews, 5 randomized controlled
trials, and 3 retrospective reviews support the
safety of cuffed ETTs in infants and children. 2–5,7–13
While these studies were almost entirely performed
in the perioperative patient population, 2 studies
included patients who remained intubated for 4
hours3 or over 12 hours postoperatively.5 An addi-
tional retrospective review evaluating the use of
perioperative cuffed ETTs in 1162 infants weigh-
ing 2 to 5 kg demonstrated no increase in post-
operative airway complications.6 The use of cuffed
ETTs is associated with lower reintubation rates,
more successful ventilation, and improved accu-
racy of capnography without increasing the risk of
complications.2,5–9,11–13,16–18 Cuffed ETTs may also
decrease the risk of aspiration and atelectasis. 5,19,20
The Use of Cricoid Pressure During Intubation
Recommendations for the Use of Cricoid Pressure During Intubation
COR LOE Recommendations
3: No
Benefit C-LD
1. Routine use of cricoid pressure to reduce the risk
of regurgitation is not recommended during bag-
mask ventilation of infants and children.
3: No
Benefit C-LD
2. Routine use of cricoid pressure is not
recommended during tracheal intubation of infants
and children.
3: Harm C-LD
3. If cricoid pressure is used, discontinue if it
interferes with ventilation or the speed or ease of
tracheal intubation in infants and children.
Synopsis
Cricoid pressure during bag-mask ventilation and dur-
ing intubation has historically been utilized to minimize
the risk of regurgitation of gastric contents into the air-
way while potentially aiding in visualization of laryngeal
structures. 21,22 However, uniform application of cricoid
pressure may impede bag-mask ventilation or obscure
visualization of the airway during laryngoscopy. 23–25
Cricoid pressure should be distinguished from ex-
ternal laryngeal manipulation where pressure is ap-
plied to the larger thyroid cartilage to facilitate airway
visualization. 26
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. A retrospective study from a large international
pediatric ICU intubation registry showed that
cricoid pressure during bag-mask ventilation
before tracheal intubation was not associated
with lower rates of regurgitation.26
2 and 3. A bronchoscopic study of 30 children revealed
distortion of the airway with the application of
cricoid pressure at forces below those rec-
ommended by usual intubation guidelines. 27
Acknowledging anatomic differences in the
airway from infancy through adulthood, rel-
evant adult data was considered, given limited
pediatric data for the use of cricoid pressure
in pediatric patients. A systematic review of
cricoid pressure during rapid sequence intuba-
tion in adult emergency department patients
found insufficient evidence to conclude if

cricoid pressure affected the rate of first pass
intubation success or the incidence of compli-
cations such as aspiration. 25 In a study of 60
adult patients undergoing elective anesthesia,
cricoid pressure interfered with bag-mask ven-

Atropine Use for Emergency Intubation
Recommendations for Atropine Use for Emergency Intubation
COR LOE Recommendations
2b C-LD
1. It may be reasonable to use atropine as a
premedication to prevent bradycardia in infants
and children during emergency intubation.
2b C-LD
2. When atropine is used as a premedication for
emergency intubation of infants and children, a
dose of 0.02 mg/kg with no minimum dose may be
considered.
Synopsis
Pediatric emergency intubation is a lifesaving, high-risk
procedure that can be complicated by hypoxemia, bra-
dycardia, hypotension, and cardiac arrest. Peri-intubation
```
bradycardia may occur in response to (1) the underly-
```
```
ing disease process that led to respiratory failure, (2)
```
```
hypoxemia, (3) medications given for rapid sequence
```
```
intubation, (4) the transition from negative to posi-
```
```
tive pressure ventilation, and (5) vagus nerve stimula-
```
tion during laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation,
particularly in infants.28,29 Previous guidelines have dis-
couraged the routine administration of atropine before
intubation but state that atropine pretreatment may be
reasonable to prevent vagally mediated bradycardia in
select populations. 30 Observational studies demonstrate
an association between atropine pretreatment and de-
creased bradycardia, higher heart rates without ventricu-
lar arrhythmias, and increased ICU survival.31,32 However,
there is little evidence to support the use of atropine as a
pretreatment for the prevention of peri-intubation cardio-
pulmonary compromise or cardiac arrest.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. Two prospective, observational studies conducted
between 2007 and 2009 in patients <8 years of
age intubated in the PICU or by critical care trans-
port teams showed associations between atropine
```
pretreatment and (1) decreased ICU mortality
```
```
after propensity score adjustment and (2) signifi-
```
cant acceleration in heart rate without provoking
arrhythmias and a decrease in bradycardia.31,32
Conversely, 4 retrospective, observational studies
did not demonstrate an association between atro-
pine use and occurrence of bradycardia during the
peri-intubation period.33–36
2. Historically, a minimum dose of atropine (0.1 mg)
was recommended to prevent paradoxical bra-
dycardia based on a 1971 study of 79 patients
undergoing elective surgery, of which 5 participants
were between 6 weeks and 3 years of age. These
infants and children had a small and statistically
insignificant decrease in heart rate after receiving
doses of atropine ranging from 0.0018 to 0.0036
mg/kg, approximately 10% to 20% of the recom-
mended dose for atropine pretreatment for intu-
bation.37 In 2015, in a prospective, observational
study of 60 infants less than 15 kg undergoing
elective surgery all of whom received <0.1 mg of
atropine before intubation, no patient experienced
paradoxical bradycardia or arrhythmias. 38
Monitoring Exhaled CO2 in Patients With
Advanced Airways
Recommendations for Monitoring Exhaled CO2 in Patients With
Advanced Airways
COR LOE Recommendations
1 C-LD
1. In all settings, for infants and children with
a perfusing rhythm, exhaled CO2 detection
```
(colorimetric detector or capnography) should be
```
used for confirmation of ETT placement.
2a C-LD
2. In infants and children with a perfusing rhythm and
ETT in place, it is beneficial to monitor exhaled
```
CO 2 (colorimetric detector or capnography) during
```
out-of-hospital and intra-hospital transport.
Synopsis
Confirmation of ETT placement in patients with a per-
fusing rhythm is not reliably achieved by auscultation
of breath sounds, mist in the tube, or chest rise. Either
colorimetric exhaled CO2 detection or capnography is a
more reliable method to assess initial ETT placement. In
patients with decreased pulmonary blood flow from low
cardiac output or cardiac arrest, exhaled CO2 may not be
reliable.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. Although there are no randomized controlled tri-
als linking use of exhaled CO2 detection with clini-
cal outcomes, the Fourth National Audit Project of
the Royal College of Anesthetists and the Difficult
Airway Society concluded that the failure to use
capnography contributed to adverse events, includ-
ing death and persistent neurological injury, in a
study of adults and children in the ICU and emer-
gency department settings.39 One small, random-
ized study showed that capnography was faster
than clinical assessment in premature newborns
intubated in the delivery room.40 There has been no
difference in patient outcomes in pediatric studies

comparing qualitative (colorimetric) and quantita-

```
tive (capnography or numeric display) exhaled CO2

interpreting capnography in intubated patients
may prevent adverse events.39,44,45 This has

MANAGEMENT OF BRADYCARDIA
Recommendations for the Management of Bradycardia With
Cardiopulmonary Compromise
COR LOE Recommendations
1 C-LD
1. In infants and children with bradycardia and
cardiopulmonary compromise due to increased
vagal tone or atrioventricular conduction block
not due to factors such as hypoxia, atropine is
recommended.
1 C-EO
2. In infants and children with heart rate <60 beats/
min and cardiopulmonary compromise despite
effective ventilation with oxygen, start CPR.
1 C-EO
3. In infants and children with bradycardia and
cardiopulmonary compromise that persists after
```
correction of other factors (eg, hypoxia), give
```
epinephrine IV/IO.
2b C-EO
4. Emergency transcutaneous pacing may be
considered for infants and children with
bradycardia and cardiopulmonary compromise due
to complete heart block or sinus node dysfunction
unresponsive to CPR.
Synopsis
Bradycardia associated with cardiopulmonary compro-
mise, even with a palpable pulse, may be a harbinger of
impending pulseless cardiac arrest. As such, bradycar-
dia with a heart rate of less than 60 beats per minute
in infants and children should prompt an evaluation for
cardiopulmonary compromise, including acutely altered
mental status, hypotension or other signs of shock. Cor-
rectable factors that contribute to bradycardia include
hypoxia, hypotension, hypoglycemia, hypothermia, acido-
sis, and toxic ingestions.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. Atropine increases heart rate in both children and
adults.1–4 As atropine is a vagolytic agent, use is
limited to bradycardia with cardiopulmonary com-
promise due to increased vagal tone or atrioven-
tricular conduction block, but not due to other
factors such as hypoxia.
2. Retrospective studies have shown that children
who received CPR for bradycardia with cardiopul-
monary compromise have better outcomes than
children who receive CPR for pulseless cardiac
arrest. 5–8 No studies compared outcomes between
children with bradycardia and cardiopulmonary
compromise who did or did not receive CPR,
though 1 study reported 8 patients who received
drug therapy without CPR, and all survived to hos-
pital discharge. 9
3. A retrospective, time-dependent propensity–score
matched study of pediatric patients with bradycar-
dia and cardiopulmonary compromise found that
patients who received epinephrine had worse out-
comes than patients who did not receive epineph-
rine.10 A subsequent retrospective study did not
show differences in outcomes for patients who did
or did not receive “early” epinephrine within the first
2 minutes of CPR for bradycardia and cardiopul-
monary compromise. 11 Due to limitations of these
studies, further research on the impact of epineph-
rine on patients with bradycardia and cardiopulmo-
nary compromise is required.
4. There are limited data about transcutaneous pac-
ing for refractory bradycardia in children with or
without congenital/acquired heart disease.12–14 In
patients with complete heart block or sinus node
dysfunction who have not responded to oxygen-
ation, ventilation, medications, or CPR, emergency
transcutaneous pacing may be considered.

with a pulse.

TACHYARRHYTHMIAS
Treatment of Supraventricular Tachycardia With
a Pulse
Recommendations for Treatment of Supraventricular Tachycardia With
a Pulse
COR LOE Recommendations
1 C-LD
1. In infants and children with SVT without
cardiopulmonary compromise, it is useful to
attempt vagal stimulation first.
1 C-LD
2. If IV/IO access is readily available, adenosine is
recommended for the treatment of SVT in infants
and children.
1 C-EO
3. For infants and children without cardiopulmonary
compromise whose SVT is unresponsive to vagal
maneuvers and IV adenosine, expert consultation
is recommended.
2a C-LD
4. In infants and children with SVT and
cardiopulmonary compromise, it is reasonable
to perform electrical synchronized cardioversion
starting with a dose of 0.5 to 1 J/kg. If
unsuccessful, increase the dose to 2 J/kg.
2b C-LD
5. For infants and children with SVT and
cardiopulmonary compromise unresponsive
to vagal maneuvers, adenosine, and electrical
synchronized cardioversion and for whom expert
consultation is not available, it may be reasonable
to consider either IV procainamide, amiodarone, or
sotalol.
Synopsis
```
Regular, narrow-complex tachyarrhythmias (QRS dura-
```
```
tion 0.09 second or less) are most commonly caused by
```
re-entrant circuits, although other mechanisms such as
ectopic atrial tachycardia or junctional tachycardia may
```
occur. Regular, wide-complex tachyarrhythmias (WCT;
```
```
QRS >0.09 second) can have multiple mechanisms, in-
```
cluding SVT with aberrant conduction, antidromic SVT, or
VT. SVT with aberrant conduction is the most common
cause of WCT in infants and children.1
The hemodynamic impact of SVT in the pediatric
patient can be variable, with signs of cardiopulmonary
compromise such as altered mental status, signs of
shock, or hypotension occurring in a minority of patients.
In infants and children without cardiopulmonary compro-
mise, re-entrant SVT can often be terminated with vagal
maneuvers.2–5 Adenosine remains the preferred medica-
tion initially unresponsive to vagal maneuvers. 3,6–14 For
patients with hemodynamically stable SVT that recurs
after initial successful treatment, expert consultation is
important to diagnose etiology and customize treatment.
The use of other IV antiarrhythmics including procain-
amide, amiodarone, and sotalol have been studied with
varying levels of success.15–20 When cardioversion is pro-
vided, the administration of sedation before synchronized
cardioversion can minimize the pain associated with the
shock. However, extreme caution is warranted in the
selection and dosage of sedatives in a patient with car-
diopulmonary compromise.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. Vagal maneuvers are noninvasive, have few
adverse effects, and effectively terminate SVT in
```
many cases; exact success rates for each type of
```
```
maneuver (ie, ice water to face, postural modifica-
```
```
tion) are unknown. 3 Although improved success
```
rates have been reported with a postural modifica-
tion to the standard Valsalva maneuver in adults, 2
published pediatric experience with this technique
is very limited. Upside-down positioning may be an
additional form of a vagal maneuver that is effec-
tive in children. 4
2. IV adenosine remains generally effective for ter-
minating re-entrant SVT within the first 2 doses. In
retrospective observational studies on the manage-
ment of tachyarrhythmias, none directly compared
adenosine to other drugs. 6,7,9–14 A Cochrane review
that included mostly adult studies and 1 pediatric
study showed that either adenosine or calcium
channel blockers can be used for quick termination
of SVT. 8 Given the fast onset of action, short half-
life, and favorable side effect profile, adenosine is
preferred for infants and children. 21

pulmonary compromise that is refractory to vagal

maneuvers or adenosine, expert consultation can
guide the choice of alternative second-line agents.
The risk for proarrhythmic and life-threatening
hemodynamic collapse increases with the admin-
istration of multiple antiarrhythmic agents. Multiple
medications have been used as second-line agents
for the management of adenosine-refractory SVT,
including IV verapamil, β-blockers, amiodarone,
procainamide, and sotalol.3,6,7,10,11,15,16,18–20,22,23 Few
comparative studies exist.
4. Direct current transcutaneous synchronized car-
dioversion remains the treatment of choice for
infants and children with SVT and cardiopulmo-
```
nary compromise (characterized by altered mental
```
```
status, signs of shock, or hypotension). However,
```
these cases are uncommon, and there are few
studies that report outcomes from cardioversion
of SVT.7,13,24 The administration of sedation before
synchronized cardioversion can minimize the pain
associated with the shock. However, extreme
caution is warranted in the selection and dosage
of sedatives in a patient with cardiopulmonary
compromise.
5. Procainamide and amiodarone are moderately
effective treatments for adenosine-resistant SVT. 16
```
Procainamide may be slightly more efficacious;
```
adverse effects are frequent with both therapies.
IV sotalol was approved for the treatment of SVT in
2009. Since its approval, several single-center and
1 multicenter registry have shown that IV sotalol is
effective in acute conversion of SVT, with a 60% to
100% termination rate of SVT and atrial tachyar-
rhythmias.15,17,18–20 In these studies, IV sotalol was
administered under the guidance of pediatric elec-
trophysiologists in acute care settings and no sig-
nificant adverse events were reported.

1. In infants and children with wide-complex
tachycardia without cardiopulmonary compromise,
expert consultation is recommended prior to
administration of antiarrhythmic agents.
2a C-EO
2. In infants and children with wide-complex
tachycardia with regular and monomorphic QRS
without cardiopulmonary compromise, adenosine
administration can be useful in conjunction with
expert consultation.

3. In infants and children with wide-complex
tachycardia and cardiopulmonary compromise, it
is reasonable to perform electrical synchronized

Synopsis
```
The occurrence of WCT (QRS duration >0.9 second)
```
with a pulse is rare in children and may originate from
either the ventricles or the atria.25 SVT with aberrant con-
duction is the most common cause of WCT in infants and
```
children; however, other etiologies can include antidromic
```
SVT or VT. 1 For patients with WCT and no cardiopulmo-
nary compromise, expert consultation is important to
diagnose etiology and customize treatment. The admin-
istration of sedation before synchronized cardioversion
can minimize the pain associated with the shock. How-
ever, extreme caution is warranted in the selection and
dosage of sedatives in a patient with cardiopulmonary
compromise.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. Both pediatric and adult studies have identi-
fied potential populations at risk of proarrhyth-
mic complications from antiarrhythmic therapies,
including patients with underlying cardiomyopa-
thies, long-QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, and
Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. 26–30 Given this
potential risk, expert consultation can help provide
a tailored antiarrhythmic choice to minimize the
chances of arrhythmia.
2. Given that the most common cause of WCT in
infants and children is SVT with aberrancy, 1 the use
of adenosine can be either therapeutic or diagnos-
tic. If the cause of the WCT is SVT with aberrancy,
administration of adenosine is likely to terminate
the arrhythmia. If the cause of the WCT is VT,
the administration of adenosine can be diagnos-
tic if it demonstrates ventriculo-atrial dissociation.
Adenosine should only be administered in WCT
if the tachycardia is monomorphic and regular. If
WCT is irregular, it can represent pre-excited atrial
fibrillation, and the administration of adenosine can
lead to VF. When possible, the administration of
adenosine should be done with a running rhythm
strip or multilead electrocardiogram to help with
interpretation of the adenosine response.1,31
3. Cardiopulmonary compromise is a key factor in
determining the use of electrical therapy over pri-
mary pharmacologic management in children with
WCT and a pulse. In patients with cardiopulmonary
compromise, electrical direct current synchronized
cardioversion should be provided urgently, regard-
less of suspected atrial or ventricular origin. There
is insufficient evidence describing the incidence
of WCT without cardiopulmonary compromise,
and there is no support for or against the use of
specific antiarrhythmic drugs in the management
of children with wide-complex tachycardia with a
pulse.
Figure 7 shows the algorithm for pediatric tachyarrhyth-
mia with a pulse.

TREATMENT OF MYOCARDITIS AND
CARDIOMYOPATHY
Recommendations for Treatment of Myocarditis and Cardiomyopathy
COR LOE Recommendations
1 B-NR
1. Given the high risk of cardiac arrest in infants
and children with myocarditis who demonstrate
arrhythmias, heart block, ST-segment changes,
or low cardiac output, early consideration of
transfer to an ICU for monitoring and therapy is
recommended.
2a B-NR
2. For infants and children with myocarditis or
cardiomyopathy with refractory low cardiac output,
```
ECMO/mechanical cardiac support (MCS) can
```
be beneficial to provide end-organ support and to
prevent cardiac arrest.
2a B-NR
3. In infants and children with myocarditis or
cardiomyopathy experiencing cardiac arrest, early
deployment of ECPR is reasonable.
2a C-LD
4. For infants and children with myocarditis or
cardiomyopathy and refractory low cardiac output,
when feasible, early transfer to a center with
ECMO/MCS capability is reasonable.
Synopsis
Acute decompensated heart failure can result in end-
organ compromise and rapid progression to cardiac
arrest.1 Fulminant myocarditis and cardiomyopathy are
common causes of acute decompensated heart failure
in children. 1–6 Outcomes can be optimized by early diag-
nosis and prompt intervention, including ICU monitoring
and therapy. Heart block, ventricular arrythmias, require-
ment for invasive mechanical ventilation, or signs of or-
gan failure in the patient with fulminant myocarditis are
considered a prearrest state.2–5,7,8
Early consideration of transfer to a center capable
```
of providing mechanical circulatory support (MCS) in
```
the form of a ventricular assist device is important. 3,4,9–11
Centers with more experience in the management of
these patients may have better outcomes.3 Early ECMO
cannulation of patients requiring invasive ventilation may
be associated with survival. 3,9 The use of ECMO and
MCS have improved outcomes of patients with acute

myocarditis, with a high possibility of partial or complete
recovery of myocardial function.3–6,9,11–15
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. Multiple retrospective studies have evaluated pre-
dictors of worse outcome in patients with acute
decompensated heart failure with most studies
in patients with fulminant myocarditis. There is an
increased incidence of cardiac arrest and need for
ECMO/MCS in this high-risk population. 1–3,5,7,8,10,11
Incidence of cardiac arrest in fulminant myocarditis
ranges from 25% to 75%.3,5,7,8,10 Signs of organ fail-
ure, a requirement for invasive mechanical ventila-
tion, and even modest decreases in left ventricular
fraction are associated with the need for ECMO/
MCS. 3–5,8,9,11 In 1 registry study, ventricular arryth-
mias that required treatment were strongly associ-
```
ated with mortality (OR, 8.47; 95% CI, 7.16–10.04;
```
```
P<0.001).3
```
2. The prognosis for patients with fulminant myocar-
ditis who receive ECMO or MCS can be good and
is generally better than for patients who require
ECMO due to other causes, especially those with
congenital heart disease.1,12 In 4 observational
studies, transplant-free survival to hospital dis-
charge in myocarditis patients without congenital
heart disease requiring ECMO or MCS ranged
from 72% to 80%. 4,5,9,10
3. In a cohort of 847 myocarditis patients, 60/847
```
(7.1%) had a cardiac arrest with 43/60 (72%) of these
```
patients receiving ECPR. Among ECPR patients,
```
31/43 (72.1%) survived to hospital discharge com-
```
```
pared to 11/17 (64.7%) of non-ECPR cardiac arrest
```
patients.4 In 1 study, 95% of children with myocarditis
```
who were placed on ECMO (n=15) or MCS (n=1)
```
after cardiac arrest were alive 6 months later com-
pared to 85% in nonmyocarditis patients.14
4. In a retrospective study, shorter time to ECMO can-
nulation after intubation was associated with sur-
```
vival in patients with fulminant myocarditis (3 h in
```
```
survivors, 6 h in nonsurvivors).9 A registry analysis
```
from Japan noted improved outcomes if pediatric
patients with myocarditis were managed in higher-
volume centers.3

Synopsis
The complexity and variability in pediatric congenital
```
heart disease (CHD) pose unique challenges during
```
resuscitation. Children with single-ventricle CHD typi-
cally undergo 3 staged palliative operations. The first
procedure, typically performed during the neonatal
period, creates unobstructed systemic blood flow, an
atrial communication to allow for atrial level mixing, and
regulated pulmonary blood flow to prevent pulmonary
overcirculation and to decrease the volume load on the
```
systemic ventricle 1,2 (Figure 8). During the second stage,
```
```
a superior cavopulmonary anastomosis (ie, bidirectional
```
```
Glenn/hemi-Fontan operation) is created to aid in the
```
redistribution of systemic venous return directly to the
```
pulmonary circulation (Figure 9). The Fontan procedure
```
is the final palliation where inferior vena cava blood
flow is baffled directly to the pulmonary circulation,
```
thereby making the single (systemic) ventricle preload-
```
dependent on passive flow across the pulmonary vascu-
```
lar bed (Figure 10).
```
Neonates and infants with single-ventricle physiol-
ogy have an increased risk of cardiac arrest because
of increased myocardial work from ventricular volume
```
loading, imbalances in relative systemic (Qs) and pulmo-
```
```
nary (Qp) blood flow, and potential shunt occlusion.1–3
```
Depending on the stage of repair, resuscitation may
require control of pulmonary and systemic vascular resis-
tance, administration of supplemental oxygen, interven-
tion for shunt obstruction, or the use of ECMO.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. In aortopulmonary shunt-dependent CHD patients
with suspected shunt obstruction, either cardiac
catheterization or cardiothoracic surgery can be
performed to restore patency of an obstructed
shunt. Although observational single-center reports
have not compared outcomes between procedural
```
interventions (catheter-based or surgical) versus
```
no procedural intervention for treatment of aor-
topulmonary shunt obstruction, lack of pulmonary
blood flow can lead to severe cardiopulmonary
compromise and cardiac arrest.1–4 ECMO can be
deployed to rescue the shunt-dependent patient
with cardiopulmonary compromise related to shunt
obstruction before performing interventions to
restore shunt patency.1–5

bidirectional Glenn shunt connecting the superior vena cava
to the right pulmonary artery.

Norwood repair and either a Blalock-Thomas-Taussig shunt

2. For children with single ventricle CHD after initial
```
surgical palliation (eg, Blalock-Thomas-Taussig
```
```
shunt, Stage I Norwood) needing postoperative
```
ECMO for management of low cardiac output
state, reported survival rates range from 31%
to 53%. 3,5,7–9 In 1 small observational study of
patients undergoing staged palliation, survival
rates were statistically unchanged in patients
```
who received elective ECMO (n=15) compared
```
```
to ECPR (n=10) (55% versus 36%, P=0.17). 7 In
```
another study, neonates with hypoplastic left heart
syndrome status post–Stage I palliation supported
with ECMO had a survival rate of 31%, compared
to 51% survival for neonates placed on ECMO for
cardiac indications as reported to Extracorporeal
Life Support Organization registry database. 5
Though reported survival rates for ECPR in this
```
cohort (32%–57%) after initial surgical palliation
```
are similar to survival rates for elective ECMO
```
(31%–53%), clinical practice standards advocate
```
for earlier recognition of the postoperative low
cardiac output state and deployment of elective
ECMO before cardiac arrest, as this may be asso-
ciated with improved long-term functional out-
comes. 5,7,10,11 There are no studies which directly
compare children with single ventricle CHD after
initial surgical palliation experiencing impending
hemodynamic collapse receiving postoperative
elective ECMO to cohorts not receiving ECMO
under similar hemodynamic conditions.
3. Medical treatment for acute aortopulmonary shunt
obstruction in peri-arrest and cardiac arrest states
can include administration of supplemental oxygen,
```
vasoactive agents (eg, epinephrine, phenyleph-
```
```
rine, norepinephrine) to maximize shunt perfusion
```
```
pressure, and anticoagulation with heparin (50–
```
```
100 units/kg bolus) to mitigate clot propagation. 1,3,6
```
4. In children with single ventricle CHD after initial
```
surgical palliation (eg, Blalock-Thomas-Taussig
```
```
shunt, Stage I Norwood) experiencing cardiac
```
arrest, observational and registry studies identify
rates of survival to hospital discharge ranging from
32% to 57%.3,5,7,9,11–16 One observational and 1 reg-
istry study of neonates with hypoplastic left heart
syndrome undergoing ECPR after Stage I palliation
noted survival rates of 32% to 36%, similar to the
survival rate of patients undergoing elective ECMO
```
(30%). 5,16 There are no studies of single ventricle
```
populations after initial stage palliation receiving
ECPR for cardiac arrest that provide compari-
sons to conventional CPR. There are limited data
on ECPR outcomes in children after Stage II and
Stage III surgical palliation. Observational studies
of ECMO support after Stage II palliation showed
an overall survival rate of 41%, with subanalysis of
ECPR in Stage II cohorts noting a survival rate of
44% to 45% 17,18 and rates of neurological injury as
```
high as 57% in Stage II ECPR survivors (Pediatric
```
```
Overall Performance Category/PCPC score ≥3).18
```
One observational study of children receiving post-
operative ECMO after Stage III surgical palliation
identified a survival rate of 27% for the subgroup
of Stage III cohorts receiving ECPR. 19 Due to a
lack of significant literature supporting ECPR use

5. In a retrospective analysis of the Extracorporeal
Life Support Organization database, among infants
undergoing Stage II palliation receiving postop-
erative ECMO support, survival rates for those
undergoing elective ECMO were similar to those
```
patients undergoing ECPR (41% versus 45%,
```
```
respectively), with a higher rate of neurological
```
injury for the cohort who received ECMO versus
```
ECPR (23% versus 0%). 17 An Extracorporeal Life
```
Support Organization database study evaluat-
```
ing children after Stage III palliation (Fontan) who
```
received postoperative ECMO noted a survival rate
of 35%.19 There are no studies which directly com-
pare children with single ventricle CHD after Stage
II or III surgical palliation experiencing impending
hemodynamic collapse receiving postoperative
elective ECMO to analogous cohorts not receiving
ECMO under similar hemodynamic conditions.

MANAGEMENT OF PULMONARY
HYPERTENSION
Management of Infants and Children at Risk for
Pulmonary Hypertensive Crises
Recommendations for the Management of Infants and Children at Risk
for Pulmonary Hypertensive Crises
COR LOE Recommendations
1 B-NR
1. For infants and children who are at risk for
pulmonary hypertensive crises, provide careful
respiratory management and monitoring to avoid
hypoxia and acidosis.
1 C-EO
2. For infants and children who are mechanically
ventilated and at risk for pulmonary hypertensive
crises, provide adequate analgesics, sedatives,
and neuromuscular blocking agents.
1 C-EO
3. For infants and children who are at risk for
pulmonary hypertensive crises, avoid dehydration,
fluid overload, and anemia.
Synopsis
Pulmonary hypertensive crises are acute rapid increases
in pulmonary artery pressure that can lead to systemic
hypotension, myocardial ischemia, cardiac arrest, and
death. Optimization of physiologic conditions and avoid-
ance of potential triggers of pulmonary hypertensive
crises can potentially avoid these events. Acidosis and
hypoxemia are both potent pulmonary vasoconstric-
tors.1–4 Inadequate sedation or uncontrolled pain can lead
to increased sympathetic activity, which raises pulmonary
vascular resistance and can exacerbate pulmonary hy-
pertension. 1,5–7 Hypovolemia in children with pulmonary
hypertension decreases preload and potentially com-
promises cardiac output, worsening the condition and
increasing hypoxia risk. Conversely, fluid overload causes
venous congestion and impairs heart function in the
setting of right ventricular dysfunction. 8 Anemia can be
problematic in patients with pulmonary hypertension due
to reduced oxygen-carrying capacity. 8

to pediatric pulmonary hypertensive crises, such as
hypoxia and acidosis, especially in high-risk popu-
lations with preexisting idiopathic pulmonary arte-
rial hypertension or with congenital heart disease
and pulmonary arterial hypertension.7,9,10 Two phys-
iologic reviews, 1 randomized clinical trial, and 2
retrospective observational studies demonstrated
that hypercarbia, hypoxemia, acidosis, atelectasis,
and ventilation-perfusion mismatch can lead to
increases in pulmonary vascular resistance and,
hence, elevation of pulmonary artery pressures in
the immediate postoperative period.1–4,11
2. Two observational studies in select high-risk post-
operative cardiac patients found an attenuation
in the stress response in those patients receiv-
ing fentanyl in the postoperative period. 5,6 Three
studies indicate that triggering factors, such
as pain and anxiety, can precipitate pulmonary
hypertension crises both during the perioperative
period and outside of it, particularly in the pres-
ence of acute lung injury, infection, or noncardiac
interventions. Managing and preventing these
aggravating factors with sedatives and analge-
sics can help prevent recurrent, more severe, and
prolonged pulmonary hypertension crises. 7,10,12
Neuromuscular blockade can be used in addi-
tion to sedation and analgesia in critically ill,
mechanically ventilated children with pulmonary
hypertension. 7,12
3. Hypovolemia and hypervolemia can be deleterious
to the cardiac function. Right ventricular decom-
pensation may result from conditions leading to
increases in cardiac demand or increases in ven-
tricular afterload. Two consensus statements on
the treatment of pediatric pulmonary hypertension
emphasize the importance of managing triggering
factors such as volume overload, dehydration, and
anemia in critically ill children with acute pulmonary
hypertension.8,10
Treatment of Infants and Children With
Pulmonary Hypertensive Crises
Recommendations for the Treatment of Infants and Children With
Pulmonary Hypertensive Crises
COR LOE Recommendations
1 B-R
1. In infants and children with pulmonary hypertensive
crises or acute right-sided heart failure secondary
to increased pulmonary vascular resistance,
inhaled nitric oxide or prostacyclin should be used
as the initial pulmonary vasodilator therapy.
2a C-LD
2. For the initial treatment of infants and children
with pulmonary hypertensive crises, oxygen
administration and induction of alkalosis through
hyperventilation or alkali administration can
be useful while pulmonary vasodilators are
administered.
2b C-LD
3. For infants and children with refractory pulmonary
hypertension, including signs of low cardiac output
or profound respiratory failure despite optimal
medical therapy, ECMO may be considered.
Synopsis
During a pulmonary hypertensive crisis, elevated pulmo-
nary vascular resistance reduces pulmonary blood flow,
```
impairing left-heart (or single ventricle) preload and ul-
```
timately leading to a fall in cardiac output. Hypoxia and
hypercarbia can significantly increase pulmonary vas-
cular resistance and trigger pulmonary hypertension
crises.1,8,10 Supplemental oxygen helps maintain oxygen
levels and lowers pulmonary artery pressures, as does
inducing alkalosis. Pulmonary vasodilators, including in-
haled nitric oxide, inhaled prostacyclin and IV prostacy-
clin analogs have been used to treat acute pulmonary
hypertensive crises while IV and oral phosphodiesterase
type-5 inhibitors, oral endothelin receptor antagonists
and oral soluble guanylate cyclase stimulators are used
as long-term therapies to lower pulmonary vascular re-
sistance and prevent pulmonary hypertensive crises.13–16
ECMO may stabilize infants with severe pulmonary hy-
pertension, low cardiac output, or severe respiratory
failure when other treatments fail,12 or during high-risk
cardiac interventions.17 Children with pulmonary hyper-
tension who require ECMO have higher mortality rates
compared to those without pulmonary hypertension. 18,19
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1 and 2. Treatment with inhaled nitric oxide reduces the
frequency of pulmonary hypertensive crises
and shortens time to extubation.20 In patients
with atrioventricular septal defect repair and
severe postoperative pulmonary hypertension,
inhaled nitric oxide administration is associated
with reduced mortality. 15,21 Inhaled prostacyclin
transiently produces pulmonary vasodilation
and improves oxygenation, but the alkalinity of
the drug can irritate airways, and precise dosing
can be complicated by drug loss in the nebu-
lization circuit. 12,22 Two physiologic reviews and
1 randomized clinical trial demonstrated that
hypercarbia, hypoxemia, acidosis, atelectasis,
and ventilation-perfusion mismatch can lead to
increases in pulmonary vascular resistance and
elevation of pulmonary artery pressures in the
immediate postoperative period after cardiac
surgery.2–4 One prospective study on the right
ventricular response to hypercarbia following
cardiac surgery showed that hypercarbia sig-
nificantly increased pulmonary vascular resis-
tance by 54% and mean pulmonary arterial
pressure by 34%. 23 In addition, a prospective

study in infants after cardiopulmonary bypass
demonstrated that increasing the arterial pH
by the administration of sodium bicarbonate
resulted in significant reduction of pulmonary
vascular resistance with both a decrease in
mean pulmonary arterial pressure and a con-
comitant increase in cardiac index. 24
3. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation has
been used in children with pulmonary vascular
disease in refractory low cardiac output states
and cardiac arrest. 25,26 Although outcomes
remain poor in certain populations, 27 advances
in technology of extracorporeal devices may
allow for bridging to durable MCS or to trans-
plantation. 17,28 Although patients with pulmo-
nary hypertension who require ECMO have a
high mortality rate, provision of ECMO can be
lifesaving.12,29,30
Pulmonary Hypertension–Specific Therapies
and Interventions for the Treatment of Infants
and Children in Cardiac Arrest
Recommendation for Pulmonary Hypertension–Specific Therapies
and Interventions for the Treatment of Infants and Children in Cardiac
Arrest
COR LOE Recommendation
2b C-EO
1. In infants and children with pulmonary
hypertension experiencing cardiac arrest, it is
unknown whether the addition of pulmonary
hypertension–specific therapies improves CPR
outcomes compared to standard CPR.
Synopsis
Among children with in-hospital cardiac arrest, pulmonary
hypertension is a common preexisting condition, and sev-
eral observational studies have found an association be-
tween pulmonary hypertension and lower cardiac arrest
survival rates.19,31–34 Despite inhaled nitric oxide showing
efficacy in preclinical large animal models of cardiac ar-
rest associated with pulmonary hypertension,35,36 stud-
ies on optimal management for children with pulmonary
hypertension-associated cardiac arrest are scarce, and
the efficacy of specific intra-arrest therapies is unknown.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. No intra-arrest therapies have been prospectively
compared to standard resuscitation therapies for
pulmonary hypertension-associated cardiac arrest.
One observational study reported that 55% of chil-
dren with pulmonary hypertension and in-hospital
cardiac arrest were receiving inhaled nitric oxide at
the time of arrest, but did not identify associations
with survival.32 No studies have prospectively inves-
tigated pulmonary vasodilator therapy during pedi-
atric cardiac arrest.

MANAGEMENT OF TRAUMATIC CARDIAC
ARREST
Recommendations for the Management of Traumatic Cardiac Arrest
COR LOE Recommendations
1 C-EO
1. In infants and children with traumatic cardiac arrest,
evaluation and treatment for potentially reversible
causes such as hemorrhage, tension pneumothorax,
and pericardial tamponade are recommended.
2b C-LD
2. In infants and children with traumatic cardiac
arrest secondary to penetrating thoracic injury with
a short transport time, it may be reasonable to
perform resuscitative thoracotomy.
Synopsis
Unintentional injuries are the most common cause of
death among children and adolescents. 1 Although many
organizations have established trauma care guidelines, 2–4
the management of traumatic cardiac arrest is often in-
consistent. Cardiac arrest due to major blunt or pene-
trating injury in children has a very high mortality rate. 5–8
Suspect thoracic injury in all thoraco-abdominal trauma
because tension pneumothorax, hemothorax, pulmonary
contusion, or pericardial tamponade may impair hemody-
namics, oxygenation, and ventilation.
This topic was last reviewed in the 2020 AHA Guide-
lines for CPR and ECC. These recommendations have not
been updated for this edition of the Guidelines.9
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. Early correction of reversible causes by reducing
delays in the delivery of trauma-specific interven-
tions may increase survival following penetrating
traumatic cardiac arrest.10,11 Guidelines for cardiac
arrest due to trauma recommend opening the airway,
relieving tension pneumothorax hemorrhage control,
restoring circulating blood volume, and relieving ten-
sion pneumothorax. Perform these measures simul-
taneously with conventional resuscitation.
2. Systematic reviews, 12–15 multicenter retrospec-
tive studies,16,17 and single-center retrospective
studies 18 recommend emergent thoracotomy for
pediatric patients who present pulseless after
penetrating thoracic injury. However, there is no
evidence to support emergent thoracotomy for
infants and children with blunt injury presenting in
cardiac arrest. 13,19

CRITICAL KNOWLEDGE GAPS AND
ONGOING RESEARCH
During the literature review process, we identified sev-
eral critical knowledge gaps related to PALS. These top-
ics are either current areas of ongoing research or lack
significant pediatric evidence to support evidence-based
recommendations.
The causes of pediatric cardiac arrest are very
different from cardiac arrest in adults, and pediatric
studies are critically needed. As often occurs in the
development of pediatric medical guidelines, some
recommendations are extrapolated from adult data.
However, infants and children are distinct patient pop-
ulations and dedicated pediatric resuscitation research
is a priority given the more than 20 000 cardiac arrests
that occur in infants and children in the United States
each year. These critical knowledge gaps are identi-
fied areas that, when addressed, will be the founda-
tional future knowledge to advance how we care for
patients.
Critical knowledge gaps are summarized in Table 2.
