ABSTRACT: Cardiac arrest is common and deadly, affecting up to 700 000 people in the United States annually. Advanced
```
cardiac life support measures are commonly employed to improve outcomes. This 2025 guideline on adult post–cardiac arrest
care from the American Heart Association summarizes the most recent published evidence for and recommendations on
several important areas of post–cardiac arrest management. Based on structured evidence reviews, guidelines are provided
for initial blood pressure, oxygen, ventilation, and glucose goals. Evidence evaluating the routine use of antibiotics after
return of spontaneous circulation is reviewed. The update also reviews diagnostic testing modalities, temperature control
goals and duration, and the use of percutaneous coronary intervention and mechanical circulatory support in the patient
resuscitated from cardiac arrest. New data regarding the detection and management of seizures have been incorporated,
along with updates regarding the timing and modalities used in neuroprognostication. These guidelines now differentiate
prognostication for favorable versus unfavorable outcome. New sections on the utility of advanced neuromonitoring, along
with definitions and treatment options for myoclonus, are included to guide the clinician. Expanded recommendations
regarding how to optimize survivorship for patients, caregivers, and rescuers are reviewed. Finally, the potential role of organ
donation in the patient resuscitated from cardiac arrest is reviewed.

TOP 10 TAKE-HOME MESSAGES FOR
ADULT ADVANCED CARDIOVASCULAR
LIFE SUPPORT
1. The section on neuroprognostication was updated
to include predictors of favorable outcome, and
```
neurofilament light chain (NfL) was added as a
```
serum biomarker: When performed in combination
with other prognostic tests, it may be reasonable
to consider high serum values of neuron-specific
```
enolase (NSE) or NfL within 72 hours after car-
```
diac arrest to support the prognosis of unfavor-
able neurological outcome in patients who remain
comatose.
2. It is reasonable that temperature control be main-
tained for at least 36 hours in adult patients who
remain unresponsive to verbal commands after
```
return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC).
```
3. It may be reasonable to perform computed tomog-
```
raphy (CT) for adult patients after ROSC to
```
investigate the etiology of cardiac arrest and com-
plications from resuscitation, and it may be reason-
able to perform echocardiography or point-of-care
cardiac ultrasound for adult patients after ROSC
to identify clinically significant diagnoses requiring
intervention.
4. Coronary angiography is recommended prior to
hospital discharge in adult cardiac arrest survivors

with suspected cardiac etiology, particularly in the
presence of an initial shockable rhythm, unex-
plained left ventricular systolic dysfunction, or evi-
dence of severe myocardial ischemia.
5. Hypotension should be avoided in adults after
ROSC by maintaining a minimum mean arterial
```
pressure (MAP) of at least 65 mm Hg, though
```
there is insufficient evidence to recommend a
specific vasopressor to treat low blood pressure in
adult patients after cardiac arrest.
6. In adult patients with cardiogenic shock (CS) after
cardiac arrest and ROSC, temporary mechanical
```
circulatory support (MCS) should not be routinely
```
used, though in highly selected adult patients with
refractory CS after cardiac arrest and ROSC, tem-
porary MCS may be considered.
7. A new section dedicated to diagnosis and man-
agement of myoclonus after cardiac arrest was
developed and includes the following: Treatment to
suppress myoclonus without an electroencepha-
```
lography (EEG) correlate is not recommended in
```
adult survivors of cardiac arrest.
8. A therapeutic trial of a nonsedating antiseizure
medication may be reasonable in adult patients
who do not follow commands after ROSC with
EEG patterns on the ictal-interictal continuum.
9. It is recommended that cardiac arrest survivors
and their caregivers have structured assessment
and treatment/referral for emotional distress
after medical stabilization and before hospital
discharge.
10. Interventions to address health care professional
burnout may be beneficial.
INTRODUCTION
Scope of the Guidelines
```
This 2025 post–cardiac arrest care (PCAC) guideline
```
```
from the American Heart Association (AHA) is based
```
on the expert writing group review of the relevant Inter-
```
national Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR)
```
Consensus on Science With Treatment Recommenda-
```
tions (CoSTR) documents and the studies included in
```
the systematic reviews as well as new evidence updates
conducted by the writing group. The writing group dis-
cussion and evidence reviews were conducted within
the context of the clinical environments in which out-of-
hospital and in-hospital resuscitations occur, with special
consideration for the health care professionals who use
these PCAC guidelines.
Organization of the Writing Group
The PCAC Focused Update Writing Group includ-
ed a diverse group of experts with backgrounds in
emergency medicine, neurocritical care, interventional
and critical care cardiology, psychology, and pulmo-
nary critical care. Group members were appointed by
the AHA Emergency Cardiovascular Care Science
Subcommittee and approved by the AHA Manuscript
Oversight Committee. Writing group members were
selected to represent diverse backgrounds in clinical
medicine and research expertise as well as to form a
group that was institutionally diverse.
The AHA has rigorous conflict of interest poli-
cies and procedures to minimize the risk of bias
or improper influence during the development of
guidelines. Before appointment, writing group mem-
bers disclosed all relevant commercial relationships
```
and other potential (including intellectual) conflicts.
```
These procedures are described more fully in “Part 2:
Evidence Evaluation and Guidelines Development” of
the 2020 American Heart Association Guidelines for
Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Car-
diovascular Care. 1 Appendix 1 of this document lists
the writing group members’ relevant relationships
with industry.
METHODOLOGY AND
EVIDENCE REVIEW
The writing group members evaluated the current list of
patient, intervention, comparison, and outcome ques-
tions included in current PCAC guidelines. Patient,
intervention, comparison, and outcome questions with
novel evidence were revisited by the writing group. For
each targeted patient, intervention, comparison, and
outcome question, writing group members created a
search strategy or utilized a previously created ILCOR
search strategy when available. Search strategies
were internally peer reviewed. This search was exe-
cuted in Medline and Excerpta Medica Database using
the Ovid search interface and in the Cochrane Central
Register of Controlled Trials. Final searches were exe-
cuted in November 2024. Search results were not lim-
ited by language or year. Two writing group members
performed dual screening of the titles and abstracts of
all articles identified from each search and identified
articles for full text review. Screening conflicts were
resolved between the 2 writing group members and
writing group leadership before full text review. Two
writing group members reviewed the full text of all se-
lected articles and applied the information contained
to develop treatment recommendations appropriate
for each clinical question. Each draft recommenda-
tion was created by a group of 2 or 3 writing group
members and then reviewed and refined by all writing
group members during regular virtual meetings. The fi-
nal manuscript was reviewed and approved by all writ-
ing group members.

Class of Recommendation and Level of
Evidence
As with all AHA guidelines, each recommendation in this
focused update is assigned a Class of Recommenda-
```
tion (COR) based on the strength and consistency of the
```
evidence, alternative treatment options, and the impact
```
on patients and society (Table 1). The Level of Evidence
```
```
(LOE) is based on the quality, quantity, relevance, and
```
consistency of the available evidence. For each recom-
mendation, the writing group discussed and approved
specific recommendation wording and the COR and LOE
assignments. In determining the COR, the writing group
considered the LOE and other factors, including systems
issues, economic factors, and ethical factors like equity,
acceptability, and feasibility. These evidence-review meth-
ods, including specific criteria used to determine COR
and LOE, are described more fully in “Part 2: Evidence
Evaluation and Guidelines Development” of the 2025
guidelines.1 The writing group members had final author-
ity over and formally approved these recommendations.
Guideline Structure
The guidelines are organized into knowledge chunks,
grouped into discrete modules of information on spe-
cific topics or management issues. 2 Each modular
knowledge chunk includes a table of recommenda-
tions that uses standard AHA nomenclature of COR
and LOE. A brief synopsis is provided to put the rec-
ommendations into context with important background
information and overarching management or treatment
concepts. Recommendation-specific supportive text
clarifies the rationale and key study data supporting
the recommendations. When appropriate, additional
tables are included.
This 2025 document updates the recommendations
for the use of MCS, vasopressor choice, ventilatory goals,
coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary inter-
```
vention (PCI), temperature control, seizure management
```
```
(with a new section on postarrest myoclonus), and survi-
```
```
vorship after cardiac arrest (Figure 1). This 2025 update
```
is based on the evidence identified in systematic reviews
performed by ILCOR and this writing group address-
ing novel data that has been published since the formal
release of the 2020 AHA advanced life support guide-
lines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and the 2023
AHA Focused Update on Adult Advanced Cardiovascular
Life Support.1,3
Document Review and Approval
These guidelines were submitted for blinded peer review
to 5 subject matter experts nominated by the AHA. Be-
fore appointment, all peer reviewers were required to dis-
close relationships with industry and any other conflicts
of interest, and all disclosures were reviewed by AHA
staff. Peer reviewer feedback was provided for guidelines
in draft format and again in final format. All guidelines
were reviewed and approved for publication by the AHA
Science Advisory and Coordinating Committee and the
AHA Executive Committee. Comprehensive disclosure
information for peer reviewers is listed in Appendix 2.

OXYGENATION TARGETS IN ADULT
PATIENTS AFTER CARDIAC ARREST
Recommendations for Oxygenation Targets in Adult Patients After
Cardiac Arrest
COR LOE Recommendations
1 B-R
1. The use of 100% inspired oxygen is recommended
```
until the arterial oxygen saturation (Spo2) or the
```
```
partial pressure of arterial oxygen (Pao2) can be
```
reliably measured in adult patients after ROSC.
1 B-NR 2. Hypoxemia should be avoided in adult patientsafter ROSC.
2a B-R
3. Once reliable measurement of oxygen saturation
is available, it is reasonable to avoid hyperoxemia
and hypoxemia by titrating the fraction of inspired
```
oxygen (Fio2) to target oxygen saturation of 90%
```
```
to 98% (Pao2, 60–105 mm Hg) in adult patients
```
after ROSC.
2b C-LD
4. When relying on pulse oximetry, health care
professionals should be aware of the increased
risk of inaccuracy that may conceal hypoxemia in
patients with darker skin pigmentation.
Synopsis
Delivery of oxygen to the brain and other vital organs
is critical in resuscitation. There are theoretical risks
associated with both hyperoxemia and hypoxemia. 1,2
Hyperoxemia may contribute to the development of
reactive oxygen species in ischemic tissue, worsen-
ing oxidative injury and cell death. 3 Hypoxemia may

cause additional injury to end-organs and exacerbate
the ischemic injury caused by the initial cardiac arrest. 4
Limitations in the ability to accurately measure oxy-
```
gen saturation (Spo 2 ) after cardiac arrest can occur
```
due to technological limitations in the prehospital
setting and poor perfusion. 5 Additionally, pulse oxim-
etry may be less accurate in patients with darker skin
pigmentation. 6,7

```
Hirsch et al Post–Cardiac Arrest Care: 2025 AHA Guidelines for CPR and ECC
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. In settings where accurate measures of Spo2
or Pao2 cannot be obtained, maintaining an
Fio2 of 100% until a reliable measure of oxy-
genation is obtained can help avoid hypoxemia.
Administration of 100% oxygen immediately
after ROSC until oxygen saturation can reli-
ably be measured is supported by the EXACT
```
(Reduction of Oxygen After Cardiac Arrest) ran-
```
domized trial. 5 This study found an increase in
hypoxemic events in the prehospital setting when
Fio2 was adjusted to maintain lower as compared
to a higher Spo2 target. 5
2. Hypoxia increases the risk of end-organ dam-
age, and hypoxemia is a widely available surro-
gate for hypoxia. Observational studies are mixed,
with at least one study showing worse outcomes
in patients experiencing post-ROSC hypoxemia. 8
These observational data are supported by the
EXACT randomized trial, which demonstrated that
lower oxygen targets in the prehospital and emer-
gency department setting led to more hypoxemic
episodes and lower survival.5,9
3. Several clinical trials have compared different
Spo2 and Pao2 targets after ROSC in a variety of
clinical settings with no superior or inferior target
identified. 5,10,11 An Spo2 target of 90% to 98%
```
(Pao2 target, 60–105 mm Hg) reflects the ranges
```
studied in key randomized trials. In a prespeci-
fied subgroup of patients with hypoxic-ischemic
encephalopathy in one clinical trial, patients ran-
domized to a conservative oxygen therapy arm
emphasizing protocolized reduction of Fio2 had
better outcomes than those in a usual care arm. 12
Observational studies have found an association
```
between severe hyperoxemia (Pao2, >250 mm Hg)
```
and worse outcomes. 13
4. Patients with darker skin pigmentation may
develop “occult hypoxemia,” wherein the Spo 2 on
pulse oximeter reads in the normal range but the
Pao 2 is in the hypoxemic range.7,14–16
VENTILATION TARGETS IN ADULT
PATIENTS AFTER CARDIAC ARREST
Recommendations for Ventilation Targets in Adult Patients After
Cardiac Arrest
COR LOE Recommendations
1 B-R
1. Arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (Paco2)
should be maintained within a normal physiologic
```
range (generally 35–45 mm Hg) in adult patients
```
who remain comatose after ROSC.
2b B-NR
2. It may be reasonable to obtain a blood gas
measurement to assess Paco2 in mechanically
ventilated adult patients after ROSC.
Synopsis
Management of carbon dioxide during the postarrest
phase is necessary given its role in regulating cerebral
blood flow. Hypocapnia-induced vasoconstriction may lead
to cerebral ischemia, while hypercapnia may exacerbate
```
elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) through increased ce-
```
rebral blood volume associated with vasodilation.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. Although a strategy of mild permissive hypercap-
```
nia (target Paco2, of 50–55 mm Hg) might improve
```
brain perfusion, observational studies have dem-
onstrated mixed results on patient outcomes. 8,17–19
```
The TAME (Targeted Therapeutic Mild Hypercapnia
```
```
after Resuscitated Cardiac Arrest) randomized
```
trial compared the maintenance of normocapnia
```
(Paco2, 35–45 mm Hg) to mild hypercapnia (Paco 2,
```
```
50–55 mm Hg) for 24 hours in patients who
```
remained comatose after cardiac arrest and found
no difference in neurologic outcome at 6 months
or in other secondary outcomes. 20 Although there
was no outcome difference overall, the interven-
tion in the TAME trial was stopped more often in
the mild hypercapnia arm, possibly in response
to severe acidemia because the protocol recom-
mended suspending the intervention if pH <7.1
and base excess <−6 mmol/L. As a result, main-
taining the Paco2 within a normal physiologic range
```
(generally, 35–45 mm Hg) is supported. Whether
```
targets should be individualized based on individual
patient physiology remains unknown.
2. The ability to measure Paco2 after arrest is limited
without blood gas measurement, and observational
studies 21–24 suggest that end-tidal carbon dioxide
levels may be falsely low and may not accurately
reflect Paco2 levels in post–cardiac arrest patients.

BLOOD PRESSURE TARGETS IN ADULTS
AFTER CARDIAC ARREST
Recommendation for Blood Pressure Targets in Adults After Cardiac
Arrest
COR LOE Recommendation
1 B-R
1. Hypotension should be avoided in adults after
ROSC by maintaining a minimum MAP of at least
65 mm Hg.
Synopsis
Adequate blood pressure is important after cardiac arrest
to maintain end-organ perfusion, including to the brain
and heart. Determining the optimal blood pressure for
an individual patient can be influenced by characteristics
like the degree of myocardial dysfunction, the prearrest
baseline blood pressure, the cause of hypotension, and
the degree of neurologic injury. 1 The physiologic rationale
for considering a higher MAP after cardiac arrest relates
to impaired cerebral blood flow autoregulation, which can
potentially impair the ability of the brain to maintain per-
fusion, even at normal MAP.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. Hypotension and shock occur in at least two thirds
of patients after cardiac arrest. Observational stud-
ies have associated hypotension with worse over-
all survival and lower rates of favorable neurologic
outcome after cardiac arrest.2–6 Four randomized
trials including over 1000 patients compared lower
```
(a cutoff of ≤70 mm Hg) to higher (≥71 mm Hg)
```
MAP targets after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
```
(OHCA). 7–10 These studies did not demonstrate
```
better overall survival or favorable neurologic out-
come with higher MAP targets.11 The median MAP
achieved in the lower MAP arms was approxi-
mately 65 mm Hg, which is the standard minimum
MAP recommended for other forms of critical ill-
ness, including CS and sepsis. Collectively, these
trials do not provide evidence for a different MAP
goal in patients after cardiac arrest. 11–13 The safety
```
of a lower MAP target (eg, 60–65 mm Hg) has not
```
been evaluated in post–cardiac arrest patients.14
```
It is also unknown if a higher MAP target (eg,
```
```
80–100 mm Hg) may be beneficial for some

DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES FOR ADULTS
AFTER CARDIAC ARREST
Recommendations for Diagnostic Studies for Adults After Cardiac
Arrest
COR LOE Recommendations
1 B-NR
1. A 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) should be
obtained as soon as feasible for all adult patients
after ROSC.
2b B-NR
2. It may be reasonable to perform head-to-pelvis CT
for adult patients after ROSC to investigate the
etiology of cardiac arrest and complications from
resuscitation.
2b C-LD
3. It may be reasonable to perform echocardiography
or point-of-care cardiac ultrasound for adult
patients after ROSC to identify clinically significant
diagnoses requiring intervention.
Synopsis
Diagnosis and treatment of the underlying cause of
cardiac arrest as well as identification and treatment
of complications from cardiac arrest and cardiopulmo-
```
nary resuscitation (CPR) are important considerations
```
in postarrest care. Twelve-lead ECG, echocardiography,
point-of-care cardiac ultrasound, and CT imaging are
used in postarrest patients to identify clinically significant
diagnoses requiring intervention. These diagnostic mo-
dalities are complementary, with patients often receiving
multiple studies. While the majority of patients resuscitat-
ed from cardiac arrest have abnormal findings on these
studies, these are not always diagnostic for the specific
etiology of cardiac arrest and may not change clinical
management.1–7 The performance, timing, and interpreta-
tion of each study is guided by the clinical context. It is
also important to note that the considerations regarding
diagnostic imaging for an in-hospital cardiac arrest may
differ from those in OHCA and that most of the available
literature focuses on OHCA.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. A 12-lead ECG obtained after ROSC can iden-
tify arrhythmia, ST-segment elevation myocar-
```
dial infarction (STEMI), and other diagnoses
```
associated with cardiac arrest for which treat-
ment or monitoring is indicated. While the ECG
is critical in identifying patients with STEMI or
STEMI-equivalent patterns, 8,9 its accuracy for
these diagnoses in the immediate post-ROSC
period has limitations. 1,10–14 Electrocardiograms

Hirsch et al Post–Cardiac Arrest Care: 2025 AHA Guidelines for CPR and ECC
performed within the first 8 minutes following
ROSC have been shown to have higher false
positive rates for STEMI than those performed
later. 1,10 In one study, approximately two thirds of
STEMI patterns on the immediate post-ROSC
ECG evolved to non-STEMI patterns on repeat
ECG performed a median of 30 minutes later. 10
Optimal timing of an initial and repeat ECG fol-
lowing ROSC are not well defined. Furthermore,
the absence of ST-segment elevation does not
rule out an intervenable coronary lesion. 11,15–18
2. Full body CT scan (ie, head to pelvis) can diagnose
pathologies contributing to cardiac arrest, includ-
ing but not limited to intracerebral hemorrhage,
pulmonary embolism, cardiac tamponade, aortic
dissection, and pneumothorax. A 2019 systematic
review evaluating post–cardiac arrest imaging to
determine arrest etiology included 17 observa-
tional studies and found that, despite heterogene-
ity in the CT protocols, the diagnostic yield of CT
scans for clinically significant diagnoses and inju-
ries ranges from 8% to 54%, 3 with several stud-
ies indicating an approximate yield of 30%.7 This
review was limited by the small number of patients
included in the individual studies and the fact that
few studies are prospective and that none were
randomized.
CT imaging can also identify complications of car-
diac arrest or resuscitation, such as fractures, aspi-
ration, pulmonary contusions, pneumothorax, and
hemorrhage, which may inform subsequent medi-
cal interventions.3–7,19,20 Small observational studies
showed that patients resuscitated from OHCA may
have CPR injuries identifiable by CT, 21–23 including
a small proportion of time-critical injuries, such as
liver/splenic lacerations and pneumothoraces. 6
CT imaging carries risks such as contrast-associ-
ated nephropathy. Transporting critically ill patients
also carries the risks of hemodynamic instabil-
ity, dislodging medical equipment, and delaying
other interventions24,25 that are weighed against
the benefits of obtaining additional diagnostic
information. 3–7
Head CT for neuroprognostication is discussed
elsewhere.
3. Echocardiography and point-of-care cardiac
ultrasound have been studied in the intra-arrest
setting for a variety of purposes, including iden-
tification of a reversible cause for cardiac arrest.
Available data suggest that these modalities can
also contribute to elucidating the etiology of car-
diac arrest in the postarrest setting. Diagnoses
that have been evaluated with echocardiography
or point-of-care ultrasound include pericardial
effusion, pericardial tamponade, right ventricular
dilation suggestive of pulmonary embolism, aortic
dissection, cardiac regional wall motion abnor-
malities suggestive of myocardial infarction, car-
diomyopathy, and hypovolemia. 3,26–35 An important
limitation of most studies is that echocardiogra-
phy or point-of-care ultrasound diagnoses were
```
not compared to a reference standard 32 ; thus, the
```
accuracy of these studies for most diagnoses can-
not be quantified. 3,36 Data are limited on whether
cardiac regional wall motion abnormalities have an
additional benefit when ECG and cardiac troponin
results are considered. 29,37 Noncardiac point-of-
care ultrasound protocols have been described,
but limited data are available on their yield and
accuracy. 38–40 The optimal time frame, operator,
and technique for performing ECG or point-of-
care cardiac ultrasound following ROSC remain
uncertain. 36 Ultrasound is operator dependent,
and recommendations for sonographer train-
ing and competencies are available from other
organizations. 41–43

TEMPERATURE CONTROL AFTER
CARDIAC ARREST IN ADULTS
Recommendations for Temperature Control After Cardiac Arrest in
Adults
COR LOE Recommendations
1 B-R
1. A deliberate, protocolized strategy of temperature
control is recommended for all adults who are
unresponsive to verbal commands after ROSC,
irrespective of arrest location or presenting rhythm.
1 B-R
2. Maintaining a temperature between 32 °C and 37.5
°C in patients unresponsive to verbal commands

ROSC.
2b B-R
4. The benefit of strategies other than rapid infusion
of cold intravenous fluids for prehospital cooling is
unclear.
2b B-R
5. It may be reasonable to avoid rapid (faster than
```
0.5 °C/h) rewarming in adult patients who have
```
spontaneous hypothermia after ROSC or who are
warming after hypothermic temperature control.

```
improves outcomes in subgroups of adult patients
with higher illness severity.
3: No
Benefit B-R
7. Routine rapid infusion of intravenous fluids for
prehospital hypothermic temperature control in
adult patients after ROSC is not recommended.
Synopsis
Temperature control has been a focus of PCAC for
several decades, reflecting strong physiologic ra-
tionale, evidence of benefit from preclinical and ob-
servational studies, and benefit in some randomized
trials. 1–4 In 2023, the AHA published a focused update
on temperature control that revised recommendations
based upon newly published clinical trial data includ-
```
ing the TTM2 (Targeted Temperature Management 2)
```
```
trial and the CAPITAL CHILL (Moderate vs Mild Thera-
```
```
peutic Hypothermia in Comatose Survivors of OHCA)
```
trial. 5–7 A recent systematic review and meta-analysis
published in 2023 summarizes the multiple random-
ized trials conducted in various domains of temperature
control. 8
Temperature control refers to the period of active tem-
perature management to a hypothermic target or to a
normothermic target. In settings in which a hypothermic
target is used, a period of fever prevention or temper-
ature control to a normothermic target may follow the
hypothermic period. The entire duration of active temper-
ature management is considered temperature control.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. Multiple randomized trials have tested various
approaches to temperature control after cardiac
arrest, including surface, intravascular, and intrana-
sal cooling. Most of these trials specified deliberate
temperature control strategies in both the inter-
vention and control arms.6,7,9–11
2. A 2023 updated ILCOR systematic review 8 incor-
porates 6 additional randomized trials published
between 2021 and 2023. All trial arms controlled
temperature to between 31 °C and 37.7 °C. In the
meta-analysis, there was no difference in survival
when applying temperature control at 32 °C to
```
34 °C versus 36 °C or normothermia; however, the
```
confidence intervals did not exclude a potential
beneficial effect of temperature control at colder
temperatures. 8 None of the included trials found
worse outcomes with lower temperature goals.
Observational studies have found that adopt-
ing higher temperature targets may result in an
increased risk of fever and potentially worse out-
comes, though confounders are likely present.12–14
3. The optimal overall duration of temperature
control, including hypothermic temperature con-
```
trol (32 °C–34 °C) and normothermic or fever-
```
```
prevention temperature control (36 °C–37.5 °C), is
```
an important area of ongoing investigation. In one
randomized trial, there was no difference in out-
comes comparing hypothermic temperature con-
trol for 24 versus 48 hours, although the trial may
have been underpowered and effect estimates
favored longer temperature control durations. 10 In
another recent randomized trial, there was no dif-
ference in outcomes comparing a period of device-
based fever prevention of 12 versus 48 hours after
an initial 24-hour period of temperature control to
```
36 °C (ie, 36 versus 72 total hours of temperature
```
```
control, respectively). 15 The 2 large TTM random-
```
ized trials protocolized patients to 72 hours of total
temperature control.6,9 Recognizing evolution of
evidence and definitions with respect to tempera-
ture control, 36 hours of total temperature control
is the shortest recommended duration. Multiple
observational studies have found strong associa-
tions between post–cardiac arrest fever and poor
outcomes, including for fevers occurring after an
initial 24-hour period of temperature control.16–19

trial, which aimed to identify the optimal duration
of hypothermic temperature control for patients
with both shockable and nonshockable rhythms,
are pending after the study was stopped in June
2025.20

hospital transnasal evaporative intra-arrest cooling

versus postadmission temperature control on sur-
vival in 671 patients and found no difference in
the primary outcome of neurologically favorable
```
survival at 90 days (16.6% in the treatment group
```
```
and 13.5% in the control group).21 The ongoing
```
PRINCESS-2 trial aims to study a similar approach
in patients with shockable rhythm, a subgroup of
interest in earlier trials.22 Cooling through surface or
intravascular methods are reasonable alternatives.
5. In one small, randomized trial, there was no differ-
ence in the primary outcome of interleukin-6 level
or other outcomes comparing rewarming from
temperature control at 33 °C at a rate of 0.25 °C
per hour as compared to 0.5 °C per hour. 23 Recent
randomized trials of temperature control used
rewarming rates ranging from 0.25 °C to 0.5 °C per
hour when transitioning out of temperature control
to colder target temperatures.6,7,9–11 Patients pre-
senting with spontaneous hypothermia after ROSC
may have more severe neurologic injury and be
more susceptible to secondary injury with rewarm-
ing. In these cases, it is unclear whether passive,
```
uncontrolled rewarming (potentially at rates above
```
```
0.5 °C per hour) results in worse outcomes as com-
```
pared to slow, controlled rewarming. Approaches
to warming of patients presenting at temperatures
below target in randomized trials have varied from
allowing either active or passive warming 6 to active,
controlled warming at 0.25 °C to 0.5 °C per hour. 11
6. Most patients enrolled in temperature control tri-
als had shockable rhythms with primary cardiac
causes of arrest, despite eligibility criteria including
both shockable and nonshockable rhythms. 6,7,9,10
A patient level meta-analysis including patients
with nonshockable rhythms from the TTM2 and
HYPERION trials found no difference between
hypothermic and normothermic temperature con-
trol.24 Patients who do not meet eligibility criteria
for randomized trials or who suffer cardiac arrest
in the United States as compared to other parts of
the world may have differences in important char-
acteristics like arrest etiology, initial rhythm, witness
status, bystander CPR, and downtime.25,26 Some
observational studies suggest benefit with tem-
perature control to lower temperatures for patients
with higher illness and brain injury severity.27,28
7. There was no clear benefit to prehospital initiation
of temperature control with cold intravenous fluids
and signals of potential harm in one large random-
ized clinical trial.29

Synopsis
Patients with cardiac arrest often remain critically ill in
the immediate post–cardiac arrest period, though treat-
ments for general critical care populations may not be
universally applicable to the post–cardiac arrest patient
population. One important area in post–cardiac arrest
therapies where new observational data have emerged
is glucose control for post–cardiac arrest patients, and
this has also been studied more extensively in general
critical care populations. Patients are at risk of develop-
ing pneumonia after cardiac arrest, which is often caused
by aspiration during the cardiac arrest and resuscitation.
Thus, there is rationale to evaluate whether empiric anti-
biotic treatment can improve outcomes. Steroids are also
of physiologic interest in patients after cardiac arrest due
to their broad effects, including reducing inflammation
and possibly supporting hemodynamics. Similarly, neuro-
protective agents that act through a broad range of pos-
sible mechanisms continue to be an area of clinical and
research interest.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. A 2020 ILCOR systematic review1 identified 2
```
randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that found no
```
difference in survival or neurological outcome 2,3 in
patients treated with early prophylactic antibiotics
after cardiac arrest. One RCT 2 did find lower inci-
dence of early pneumonia in those who received
prophylactic antibiotics, but this did not translate
to a difference in other outcomes. Since then,
one observational study similarly demonstrated a
reduction of early ventilator-associated pneumonia
with prophylactic antibiotics4 but no differences
```
in other patient-oriented outcomes (ie, short-term
```
mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation, or
```
intensive care unit length of stay). Given the need
```
for general antibiotic stewardship and the findings
of the above studies, there is insufficient evidence
to suggest the use of antibiotics routinely after car-
diac arrest.
2. A recent systematic review 5 evaluated neuropro-
tective drugs and their effect on mortality and
functional outcome. Nineteen RCTs of drugs cat-
egorized as neuroprotective agents and 16 stud-
ies of drugs categorized as anti-inflammatory

including magnesium, nimodipine, inhaled gases
```
(hydrogen, nitric oxide, and xenon), coenzyme
```
```
Q10 (ubiquinol), thiamine, and others, were evalu-
```
ated. Most studies were single-center trials with
low numbers of participants. The heterogeneity of
intervention agents and trial designs limited the
ability to perform meta-analyses, and there was
overall low certainty of evidence, thus, limiting the
ability to recommend any specific agent.
3. One small RCT including 50 patients compared
steroids to placebo for post–cardiac arrest shock. 6
Time to shock reversal and other outcomes did not
differ between groups. A large retrospective obser-
vational study found that steroid use after cardiac
arrest was associated with survival. 7 A recent sys-
tematic review evaluating drug therapy compared
with placebo 5 included 2 RCTs using hydrocorti-
sone after arrest as part of a multidrug protocol. 8,9
There was insufficient evidence to perform a
meta-analysis for steroids after ROSC and insuf-
ficient evidence to recommend any specific drug
treatment after ROSC. This topic does not address
intra-arrest steroids.
4. One small RCT evaluating strict versus moder-
ate glucose control in patients resuscitated from
```
cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation (VF)10
```
found no difference in survival, though the thera-
peutic ranges for their control and experimental
arms are no longer congruent with current critical
care management. Many subsequent observational
studies have demonstrated an association between
hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia in the post–cardiac
arrest period and worse neurological outcomes and
mortality, though these were not evaluating active
glucose management interventions. 11–16 While no
RCTs have evaluated glucose targets in broad pop-
ulations of post–cardiac arrest patients, treatment
of blood glucose using insulin in the general critical
care population improves mortality and is recom-
mended in other guidelines, acknowledging risks
of hypoglycemia when lower blood glucose ranges
are targeted.17–19 Given the observational findings
in post–cardiac arrest patients, the RCT findings
in general critical care populations, and that post–
cardiac arrest patients are often critically ill, this
recommendation is updated to address avoidance
of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia without giving
a specific target glucose range.

USE OF VASOPRESSORS IN ADULTS
AFTER CARDIAC ARREST
Recommendation for Use of Vasopressors in Adults After Cardiac
Arrest
COR LOE Recommendation
2b B-NR
1. There is insufficient evidence to recommend a
specific vasopressor to treat low blood pressure in
adult patients after cardiac arrest.
Synopsis
Hypotension requiring vasopressors occurs in up to
75% of post–cardiac arrest patients. 1,2 After cardiac ar-
rest, shock is often caused by multiple etiologies, and
the shock phenotype may evolve from initial low-output
CS from post–cardiac arrest myocardial dysfunction to a
later vasodilatory shock from inflammatory vasoplegia. 2
Vasopressors are commonly used to support blood pres-
sure and cardiac output in the setting of hypotension
after cardiac arrest. Vasopressors have dose-dependent
```
differences in cardiac (inotropic), vascular (vasoconstric-
```
```
tive), and adverse (tissue ischemia, cardiac arrhythmia)
```
effects, which influence their efficacy and safety across
individuals.3
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. No large-scale RCTs have compared clinical out-
comes between different vasopressors in post–
cardiac arrest patients.4 A small prehospital RCT
```
(n=40) comparing epinephrine and norepineph-
```
rine after cardiac arrest did not show a difference
in safety or clinical outcomes. 5 Some, but not all,
observational studies with a high risk of bias and
residual confounding have suggested worse out-
comes in postarrest patients who received epi-
nephrine versus norepinephrine. 4,6 In patients with
CS, many of whom had cardiac arrest, epineph-
rine and dopamine have been associated with a
less favorable safety profile and potentially worse
```
outcomes than norepinephrine; the presence of
```
cardiac arrest did not influence this effect in one
meta-analysis comparing epinephrine to other
drug regimens. 7–9 In non–cardiac arrest patients
with vasodilatory or septic shock, epinephrine
was associated with more arrhythmias and meta-
bolic abnormalities but similar survival while dopa-
mine was associated with worse outcomes.10
Accordingly, norepinephrine is suggested as the
first-line vasopressor for patients with CS or septic
shock, but whether this recommendation applies
to undifferentiated post–cardiac arrest patients
remains unproven.11–13

PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY
INTERVENTION IN ADULTS AFTER
CARDIAC ARREST
Recommendations for PCI in Adults After Cardiac Arrest
COR LOE Recommendations
1 B-NR
1. Coronary angiography should be performed
emergently after cardiac arrest for all patients with
suspected cardiac cause of arrest and persistent
ST-segment elevation on ECG, regardless of the
presence of coma.
1 B-NR
2. Coronary angiography is recommended prior to
hospital discharge in adult cardiac arrest survivors
with suspected cardiac etiology, particularly
in the presence of an initial shockable rhythm,
unexplained left ventricular systolic dysfunction, or
evidence of severe myocardial ischemia.
2a B-NR
3. Emergency coronary angiography is reasonable
for selected adult patients after cardiac arrest with
suspected cardiac etiology without ST-segment
elevation on ECG in the presence of CS, recurrent
ventricular arrhythmias, or evidence of significant
ongoing myocardial ischemia, regardless of the
presence of coma.
3: No
Benefit B-R
4. In adult comatose patients with ROSC after
cardiac arrest, emergency coronary angiography
is not recommended over a delayed or selective
strategy in the absence of ST-segment elevation,
shock, electrical instability, or evidence of
significant ongoing myocardial ischemia.
3: No
Benefit B-R
5. In the setting of multivessel coronary artery
```
disease (CAD) in adult patients with shock
```
after cardiac arrest, immediate revascularization
of non–infarct-related coronary lesions is not
recommended over initial revascularization of only
the infarct-related artery.
Synopsis
Coronary artery disease is identified in up to two thirds1
of patients with OHCA from a presumed cardiac etiol-
ogy who undergo invasive coronary angiography, includ-
```
ing acute culprit lesions in one third of these patients;
```
the prevalence is higher in patients with VF, particularly
```
refractory VF receiving extracorporeal CPR (ECPR).2
```
Identifying and treating unstable CAD has been shown
to improve outcomes by stabilizing hemodynamics, pre-
venting recurrent arrhythmias, and preserving myocardial
function.3 The ILCOR CoSTR 4 and the 2023 AHA Fo-
cused Update 5 on this topic were reviewed, and an inde-
pendent literature search undertaken.
Observational studies have demonstrated higher
overall and favorable neurologic outcome among OHCA
patients who receive invasive coronary angiography with
PCI performed within 24 hours of admission, recogniz-
ing that selection bias and confounding by indication
can magnify this effect. Evidence regarding the optimal
timing of coronary angiography after OHCA comes from
multiple RCTs enrolling 1590 comatose hemodynami-
cally stable OHCA patients without STEMI, the majority
having a shockable rhythm.6–12 Therefore, the certainty
of data is limited for types of cardiac arrest patients
excluded from these trials. Randomized data are also
lacking for patients with ST-segment elevation or cohorts
permitted to cross over in RCTs because of the presence
of CS, signs of significant myocardial damage, electrical
instability, or ongoing ischemia. A key challenge is the
competing risk of poor outcome due to hypoxic-ischemic
brain injury in patients who had cardiac arrest compared
to those who have acute coronary syndromes but did not
have cardiac arrest. Poor outcome due to the brain injury
may mitigate and confound the potential benefit of coro-
nary revascularization in this population.13
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. The presence of STEMI or STEMI-equivalent pat-
tern on ECG after cardiac arrest implies transmural
myocardial ischemia and a high probability of acute
coronary occlusion, which can result in worsening
cardiovascular instability if not promptly revascular-
ized.14 Multiple observational studies have demon-
strated improved neurologically favorable survival
when early coronary angiography is performed fol-
lowed by PCI in patients with cardiac arrest who
have STEMI. 15 This recommendation mirrors global
recommendations for all patients with STEMI.
Randomized controlled trials examining the optimal
timing of coronary angiography after OHCA sys-
tematically excluded patients with STEMI.
2. Evaluating for CAD prior to hospital discharge with
invasive coronary angiography in cardiac arrest
survivors with a presumed cardiac etiology is sup-
ported by other cardiology-focused guidelines and
scientific statements.3,16–18 Randomized controlled
trials examining the timing of coronary angiography
after OHCA performed invasive coronary angiogra-
phy in all patients with neurological awakening.6–12
3. Cardiogenic shock (hemodynamic instability) or
```
recurrent ventricular arrhythmias (electrical instabil-
```
```
ity) after cardiac arrest can be caused by severe
```
myocardial ischemia. Patients with these unstable
cardiovascular conditions are at high risk of rearrest
if myocardial ischemia goes untreated. Randomized
controlled trials examining the timing of coronary
angiography after OHCA in comatose patients
allowed crossover to the emergent timing arm for
shock, recurrent VF, or evidence of severe myocar-
dial ischemia. Elevated serum troponin levels19–29
```
and ischemic ECG abnormalities (other than
```
```
STEMI)6,30–34 are common after OHCA but have
```
inadequate sensitivity or specificity for unstable CAD
and do not predict the benefit of invasive coronary
angiography. This makes the optimal definition of
severe myocardial ischemia uncertain, although the

Hirsch et al Post–Cardiac Arrest Care: 2025 AHA Guidelines for CPR and ECC
used a serum troponin cut-off 70 times the upper
reference limit. Patients with OHCA with refractory
VF from a presumed cardiac etiology who receive
ECPR have a high prevalence of unstable CAD, and
early invasive coronary angiography was part of the
ECPR bundle in RCTs.2,35–37
4. In multiple RCTs of stable comatose OHCA
patients without STEMI, there was no evidence
of improved overall survival or favorable neuro-
logic outcome with early invasive coronary angi-
```
ography (eg, within 2 hours) versus delayed or
```
```
selective invasive coronary angiography (eg, after
```
```
awakening), with some studies suggesting poten-
```
tial harm with early angiography. 38 In the delayed
angiography group, up to 40% of patients did
not receive invasive coronary angiography due
to lack of awakening 12 and up to 17% crossed
over to early intervention 8 due to hemodynamic
or electrical instability or severe myocardial
ischemia. Invasive coronary angiography can be
safely deferred until after neurological awakening
in comatose OHCA patients without any of the
```
following: STEMI or STEMI-equivalent patterns,
```
CS, recurrent ventricular arrhythmias, or evidence
of significant myocardial ischemia. Cardiac arrest
patients without coma were excluded from these
RCTs.
5. There is substantial overlap between the OHCA
and CS populations, as acute myocardial infarc-
tion is often the underlying pathophysiology in
both. 3,39 Multivessel CAD is identified in up to 50%
of patients receiving invasive coronary angiogra-
phy after OHCA, as in patients with CS from acute
myocardial infarction.40,41 No RCTs have examined
the optimal revascularization approach for patients
with cardiac arrest and multivessel CAD, and RCTs
examining multivessel revascularization in patients
with STEMI have excluded patients with cardiac
```
arrest.42 The CULPRIT-SHOCK (Culprit Lesion
```
Only PCI Versus Multivessel PCI in Cardiogenic
```
Shock) trial 41 randomized patients with CS from
```
```
acute myocardial infarction (including 55% OHCA
```
```
patients) who had multivessel CAD and underwent
```
culprit vessel PCI to either immediate multivessel
PCI or delayed selective multivessel PCI. Patients
randomized to immediate multivessel PCI had
higher mortality and more complications, with simi-
lar findings of harm with initial multivessel PCI in
the subgroup of patients with cardiac arrest. 43 Thus,
immediate revascularization of nonculprit coronary
lesions is not recommended over initial culprit-only
revascularization in patients with multivessel CAD
and shock after cardiac arrest and is supported by
the 2021 AHA/ACC/SCAI Guideline for coronary
revascularization and 2025 AHA/ACC Guideline
for acute coronary syndromes. 14,44

Cardiogenic shock commonly occurs as either a cause
or consequence of cardiac arrest. 1 Patients with CS are
usually managed with vasopressors and inotropes, but
treatment failures and drug toxicity are common with
these therapies.1 Temporary MCS devices have been de-
veloped to increase blood pressure and cardiac output in
patients with CS as an alternative or adjunct to vasoac-
tive drug therapy. These devices include the intra-aortic
balloon pump, percutaneous ventricular assist devices
```
(including the Impella and TandemHeart families of devic-
```
```
es), and extracorporeal membrane oxygenator (ECMO).
```
Temporary MCS devices can provide hemodynamic sta-
bilization in refractory CS, allowing time for neuroprog-
nostication and potential cardiac recovery. Balancing the
aforementioned benefits with associated increased risk
of bleeding and ischemic complications observed with
percutaneous ventricular assist devices and ECMO is
important. Temporary MCS is becoming more commonly
used as a rescue strategy for patients with refractory CS
despite initial vasoactive drug therapy. While few trials of
temporary MCS have exclusively included cardiac arrest
patients, many of the CS patients enrolled in clinical trials
of temporary MCS had cardiac arrest. Accordingly, the
evidence guiding the use of temporary MCS in CS more
broadly may apply to patients with cardiac arrest in the
absence of studies showing differential benefits in the
cardiac arrest subgroup specifically.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. Management of temporary MCS is nuanced and
requires specific knowledge. Balancing hemody-
namic needs with device management is often chal-
lenging because responses to interventions can be
paradoxical or counterintuitive during MCS. Given
these challenges, optimizing outcomes necessi-
tates a team experienced in MCS management.
Although specific team composition and training
are not well defined, a volume-outcome relation-
ship has been noted with the use of advanced tem-
porary MCS devices whereby centers with higher
volume have better patient survival, suggesting that
greater familiarity with these devices may result in
improved outcomes.2,3
2, 3. Temporary MCS devices, including intra-aortic bal-
loon pump, percutaneous ventricular assist devices,
and ECMO, can potentially improve hemodynam-
ics for patients with CS refractory to vasopressor
and inotrope therapy. No large-scale RCTs have
specifically evaluated patient-centered outcomes
with early routine use of MCS devices in cardiac
```
arrest patients. One small (n=60) RCT showed
```
no difference in mortality with early routine intra-
aortic balloon pump in patients with acute coronary
syndrome who had suffered an in-hospital cardiac
arrest with ROSC.4 Patients with cardiac arrest
```
made up the majority (64%) of patients included in
```
RCTs assessing MCS in CS, though the subgroup
of patients with cardiac arrest ranged from <20%
to >90% across studies. 4–18
In a meta-analysis of 14 trials, there was no differ-
ence in survival for CS patients treated with routine
```
MCS compared to standard of care (OR, 1.17; 95%
```
```
CI, 0.97–1.42 [ILCOR meta-analysis]). A patient-
```
level meta-analysis of 9 RCTs in acute myocardial
```
infarction CS (n=1114) found no survival benefit
```
for early routine use of percutaneous ventricular
assist devices or ECMO in the 51.6% with prior
```
cardiac arrest (HR, 0.91; 0.71–1.15). 19 Patient-
```
level subgroup analysis of 816 resuscitated car-
```
diac arrest patients from 11 RCTs (n=816) found
```
```
no difference in survival with MCS (OR, 1.21; 95%
```
```
CI, 0.91–1.60 [ILCOR meta-analysis]). The singu-
```
lar RCT that showed survival benefit with routine
use of MCS in CS patients included 20% car-
diac arrest survivors but systematically excluded
OHCA patients who were comatose after ROSC.16
Importantly, individual RCTs and meta-analyses
demonstrate increased harm, including severe
bleeding and ischemic vascular events, with the
routine use of MCS.13,15,16,18,19 Accordingly, routine

and unfavorable neurologic outcomes. Causes of sec-
ondary brain injury are heterogeneous and vary tem-
porally and between patients but include inadequate
cerebral perfusion, oxygenation, and mismatch in
metabolic supply and demand. 2 Conventional patient
monitoring by clinical examination and vital signs can
be insensitive to detecting secondary brain injury. 3,4
Advanced neuromonitoring refers to placing probes
into or adjacent to brain tissue through a cranial burr
hole or through jugular vein cannulation. These probes
permit direct and frequent measurement of ICP, cere-
```
bral blood flow, brain tissue oxygen saturation (Pbto2 ),
```
jugular venous oxygen saturation, and neurophysiology
```
(electrocorticography). 5,6 They also allow for sampling
```
```
of the interstitial space (microdialysis) and calculation
```
of cerebral autoregulation indices, such as pressure re-
activity index and optimal cerebral perfusion pressure.
These measurements can provide additional informa-
tion about cerebral physiology and facilitate targeted
interventions. While these techniques have been used
in other types of acute brain injury populations, there
has been limited investigation in hypoxic-ischemic
brain injury. Limitations of previous studies in cardiac
```
arrest populations include their observational nature;
```
```
highly selected subpopulations; variability in the timing,
```
```
duration, and methods of monitoring; and thresholds
```
used to prompt interventions.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. There are no RCTs comparing invasive neuro-
monitoring to no invasive neuromonitoring after
cardiac arrest. Eleven nonrandomized observa-
tional studies 7–17 evaluated ICP monitoring. Five
studies found an association between ICP eleva-
tion or lower intracranial compliance with poor
functional outcomes. 7,10,13,16,17 Three observational
studies using intracranial ICP monitoring evalu-
ated cerebral autoregulation using pressure reac-
tivity index. 8,13,18 The pressure reactivity index is a
measure of cerebral autoregulation derived from
the correlation of ICP and MAP. Two of these stud-
ies measured deviations from the optimal cerebral
perfusion pressure, which was associated with
mortality and lower Pbto2 . 8,18 Of 5 nonrandom-
ized studies, 2 showed that cerebral hypoxia mea-
sured using Pbto2 or arterio-jugular differences of
oxygen was more common in patients with poor
functional outcomes. 8,13–16 One single-center pro-
spective nonrandomized interventional study eval-
uated functional outcomes with care guided by
monitoring of ICP, Pbto2 , and jugular venous oxy-
gen saturation. 8 The invasive monitoring group had
superior functional outcomes at 6 months com-
pared to a historical matched comparison group.
All findings for ICP, cerebral autoregulation, Pbto2 ,
and jugular venous oxygen saturation were incon-
sistent across studies, and there was overall high
risk of bias.

Seizures and status epilepticus are common acute neu-

occurring in 10% to 35% of patients who do not follow
commands after ROSC.1–6 Cerebral hyperexcitability after
cardiac arrest may exacerbate a mismatch between neu-
ronal bioenergetic supply and demand, thereby contribut-
ing to secondary brain injury.5 Post–cardiac arrest hyper-
excitability can manifest as a wide range of electroclinical
findings, from seizures with overt clinical manifestations,
such as convulsions to periodic or rhythmic discharges
on EEG and other abnormal EEG patterns.7 Clinical or
electrographic findings can manifest with or without
impairment of consciousness and may or may not reach

the criteria for seizures or status epilepticus (Table 2).8
```
The indications for and intensity of antiseizure medi-
cations vary in clinical practice and across studies.
Although the occurrence of status epilepticus in post–
cardiac arrest patients has been associated with poor
outcomes in observational studies, 2,9,10 some patients
survive with recovery of functional independence. Myoc-
lonus is covered in a separate section because only a
subset of patients with post–cardiac arrest myoclonus
meets criteria for electroclinical seizures or status epi-
lepticus. Marked heterogeneity in the definitions of sei-
zures and status epilepticus across studies challenges
the interpretation of available data.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. In patients who are unable to follow commands
after cardiac arrest, EEG can detect nonconvulsive
```
seizures and status epilepticus (Table 3).11–13 This
```
recommendation is informed by the high preva-
lence of nonconvulsive seizures and other epilep-
tiform activity in cardiac arrest survivors. 5 However,
there is no direct evidence that detection of non-
convulsive seizures with EEG improves outcomes.
An ILCOR systematic review from 2023 did not
specifically address the timing and method of EEG
monitoring in this setting. 14
2. There are no nonrandomized trials or RCTs com-
paring the effect of treating clinical seizures versus
no seizure treatment. 14 There is no widely accepted
definition for clinically apparent seizure or status
epilepticus after cardiac arrest, and previous litera-
ture has used a variety of clinical and EEG clas-
sifications. It remains unclear which seizures or
status epilepticus represent an epiphenomenon
of severe brain injury or treatment-responsive tar-
gets to prevent secondary brain injury. Despite the
lack of high-certainty evidence, untreated clinically
apparent seizure activity is thought to be poten-
```
tially harmful to the brain; therefore, treatment of
```
seizures or status epilepticus is recommended.15
3. Seizures or status epilepticus that have no clearly
```
apparent clinical correlate, (ie, electrographic or non-
```
```
convulsive seizures or status epilepticus), emerge in
```
1% to 20% of post–cardiac arrest patients.16 The
```
American Clinical Neurophysiology Society (ACNS)
```
has developed specific criteria for electrographic
or nonconvulsive seizures or status epilepticus for
```
critically ill patients (Table 2), though prior studies
```
have used varying definitions. Given the limited
evidence to support withholding treatment of non-
convulsive seizures after arrest, a similar approach
to nonconvulsive seizure treatment for other eti-
```
ologies is reasonable. The TELSTAR (Treatment of

```
RCT of protocolized tiered treatment targeting sup-
pression of electrographic seizures, status epilep-
ticus, or interictal patterns detected on continuous
EEG in adults after arrest compared with standard
```
care (Table 2). The trial randomized 172 subjects
```
and the use of antiseizure medication was allowed
but discouraged in the standard care group. The
```
rate of unfavorable neurological outcome (defined
```
```
as Cerebral Performance Category score of 3–5)
```
did not differ at 3 months, but only 10% of patients
in both treatment groups had electrographic sei-
```
zures (the rate of clinically apparent and electroclin-
```
```
ical seizures were not reported). Although the trial
```
was not powered for subgroup analyses, patients
```
with electrographic seizures (ie, periodic discharge
```
```
frequencies surpassing 2.5 Hz), evolving patterns,
```
or those with nongeneralized periodic discharges
between 0.5 and 2.5 Hz had better outcomes with
protocolized, tiered antiseizure treatment than stan-
dard care alone.
4. There are several approaches to EEG monitor-
```
ing that vary in duration (ie, from short 20- to
```
40- minute recordings to continuous monitoring for
```
several days) and electrode arrangement (ie, from
```
full 21 electrodes to simplified 6–10 electrode
```
montages). Seizures, epileptiform abnormalities,
```
and clinical myoclonus may occur immediately after
ROSC or emerge several days after initial resusci-
tation. 7,12,18 Continuous EEG after cardiac arrest,
although more costly and labor intensive, increases
sensitivity for seizures, status epilepticus, and epi-
leptiform activity detection when compared with
brief intermittent recordings given the variability in
the timing these patterns occur and frequent lack
of clinical correlation. However, use of continuous
EEG was not associated with improvement in sur-
vival or functional outcome in observational cardiac
```
arrest studies 19,20 or the CERTA (Continuous EEG
```
```
Randomized Trial in Adults) trial, 21 a multicenter
```
pragmatic study involving critically ill patients with
impaired consciousness, of whom nearly one-third
had been post–cardiac arrest patients.
5. Cardiac arrest as the etiology of seizures and
status epilepticus has been an exclusion criterion
```
in RCTs specific to status epilepticus 22,23 ; conse-
```
quently, therapeutic algorithms are extrapolated
from other settings, including guidelines for gen-
eralized convulsive status epilepticus. The 2023
ILCOR CoSTR summary 14 recommended that
seizures be treated when diagnosed in postar-
rest patients. No specific antiseizure medications
were recommended.
6. The ACNS defines the ictal-interictal continuum as
rhythmic or periodic patterns that may be consistent
with possible nonconvulsive seizures or status epi-
lepticus even without fulfilling strict electrographic
```
criteria (Table 2).8 Patients with patterns on the
```
ictal-interictal continuum who exhibit both electro-
graphic and clinical response to a therapeutic trial
with a loading dose of a nonsedating antiseizure
```
medication (ie, not benzodiazepines) are consid-
```
```
ered to have electroclinical status epilepticus; thus,
```
therapeutic trials of antiseizure medication may be
considered for interictal findings. Clinical response
to a therapeutic trial may not be apparent on bed-
side examination in patients who are unresponsive
to commands after ROSC, therefore, determination
of an electroclinical response to a therapeutic trial
may be challenging.
7. No new studies were identified in the updated
ILCOR CoSTR summary from 2023. 14 Seizure

prophylaxis did not improve outcomes after car-
diac arrest in 2 prospective RCTs 24,25 and 1 non-
randomized prospective clinical trial with historical
controls. 26 Prophylaxis was also not effective in
preventing subsequent seizures in the post–car-
diac arrest period. 24–26 However, these studies
lacked systematic diagnosis of seizures with EEG
monitoring, seizures reported were abstracted
from clinical documentation, and the sample
size was insufficiently powered for this outcome.
Additionally, these studies were designed as ther-
apeutic trials of neuroprotection with thiopental,
magnesium and diazepam, or diazepam alone,
with the primary outcome being functional neu-
rologic outcome with the Cerebral Performance
Category scale. Therefore, their study designs
are inadequate to provide definitive evidence on
the role of seizure prophylaxis in the prevention
of acute symptomatic seizures and later devel-
opment of epilepsy following cardiac arrest.
Furthermore, the chosen therapeutic agents in
these studies 24–26 are not commonly used as sei-
zure prophylaxis in clinical practice in the current
era, thus, precluding extrapolation of findings on
seizure prophylaxis with other agents that might
have a more favorable side effect profile with
fewer sedating effects.

Diagnosis and Management of Myoclonus in
Adults After Cardiac Arrest
Recommendations for the Diagnosis and Management of Myoclonus in
Adults After Cardiac Arrest
COR LOE Recommendations
1 C-LD
1. We recommend promptly performing and
interpreting EEG for the diagnosis of seizures in
adult patients with myoclonus after ROSC.
3: No
Benefit C-LD
2. Treatment to suppress myoclonus without an EEG
correlate is not recommended in adult survivors of
cardiac arrest.
Synopsis
Myoclonus is a common clinical manifestation of
hypoxic-ischemic brain injury, being observed in approximate-
ly 18% to 34% of post–cardiac arrest patients.1–5 Myoclonus
can present as diffuse or multifocal muscle jerks or more
subtle focal motor movement involving the face and limbs.6,7
Up to half of patients with myoclonus are found to have elec-
trographic seizures or status epilepticus, and the clinical exam
alone is insufficient to predict which patients are having elec-
trographic seizures.8–10 Myoclonus with a time-locked EEG
```
correlate is a seizure (Table 2), although it is controversial
```
whether this is an epiphenomenon of hypoxic-ischemic brain
injury or if it is a seizure pattern that should be treated to pre-
vent secondary brain injury.8,10,11 Independent of the presence
of a time-locked EEG correlate, myoclonus may interfere with
supportive care and ventilatory mechanics.12,13
Post–cardiac arrest studies are limited by substan-
tial heterogeneity in definitions and terminology used
for describing and classifying myoclonus and its asso-
ciated EEG findings, including the presence of electro-
graphic seizures and status epilepticus or epileptiform
discharges or other electrographic events time locked to
```
the myoclonus8,11,14–16 (Table 3).
```
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. There is no specific clinical exam pattern, timing
of occurrence, or myoclonus pattern that is reliably
associated with the presence or absence of seizures
or status epilepticus on EEG after cardiac arrest.4,6–8
Therefore, prompt EEG monitoring is necessary to
diagnose whether myoclonus is associated with sei-
zures, status epilepticus, or the presence of other
```
EEG correlates (Table 3).16 Back averaging of
```
EEG and electromyography signals may be neces-
sary to determine the precise relationship between
```
EEG events (eg, spikes, bursts) and myoclonus.8,17
```
Myoclonus can cause significant muscle artifact on
EEG, which can be overcome with neuromuscular
blockade under close monitoring.
2. There is no randomized or nonrandomized study
evaluating the role of pharmacologic interventions
for the management of myoclonus without an EEG
correlate after cardiac arrest. Similarly, there is no
evidence implicating myoclonus without an EEG
correlate in the pathogenesis of secondary brain
injury after cardiac arrest. 18 Myoclonus after car-
diac arrest is often refractory to treatment, and mul-
tiple antiseizure medications or anesthetic agents
may be needed for myoclonus control.2,5,7,8,13,18–24
High risk of bias related to patient selection and
confounding effects and inconsistent reporting of
myoclonus and EEG characteristics in the literature
preclude a specific treatment recommendation for
myoclonus without an EEG correlate.14 The risk of
cardiovascular, neurological, and other medication
side effects outweighs the unknown benefit of
suppressing myoclonus without an EEG correlate
on patient outcomes.

NEUROPROGNOSTICATION
Introduction
Hypoxic-ischemic brain injury is the leading cause of
morbidity and mortality in patients who achieve ROSC
after OHCA and accounts for a significant portion of un-
favorable outcomes after resuscitation from in-hospital
cardiac arrest. 1,2 Most deaths attributable to brain injury
after cardiac arrest are due to withdrawal of life support
based on a predicted unfavorable neurological outcome.
Prognostication is critically important as surrogates com-
monly make decisions relying on the perceived estimat-
ed likelihood of recovery that is shared by the treatment
team. Accurate neuroprognostication is important to
avoid inappropriate withdrawal of life support in patients
who may otherwise achieve meaningful recovery and to
avoid ineffective treatment when poor outcome is inevi-
```
table (Figure 2).3
```
Neuroprognostication frequently incorporates assess-
```
ment of structural injury (eg, neuroimaging and bio-
```
```
markers) or neurological function (eg, neurophysiologic
```
```
tests and clinical examination). The ideal timing for
```
neuroprognostic tests avoids the effects of confound-
```
ing (eg, from temperature, medications, and systemic
```
```
organ dysfunction). Multiple tests are incorporated to
```
estimate the likelihood for recovery to a favorable or
unfavorable state. Most neuroprognostic studies utilize
dichotomized outcome scales, with a favorable functional
outcome defined by the ability to achieve independence
```
(ie, Glasgow-Pittsburgh Cerebral Performance Category
```
```
scores of 1–2 or modified Rankin Scale scores of 0–3),
```
although some studies have thresholds characterized
```
by recovery of consciousness (ie, Cerebral Performance
```
Category score of 1–3 or modified Rankin Scale score
```
of 0–4). These studies do not capture granular details on
```
the functional state of patients, nor do they consider their
individual preferences or values, limiting their utility. Fur-
ther guidance on best practices on the interpretation of
outcomes with a patient-centered approach is included
in “Part 3: Ethics.”

4. In adult patients who remain comatose after

the interpretation of multimodal prognostic
assessments at a minimum of 72 h after
normothermia and discontinuation of sedatives.
Synopsis
Neuroprognostication relies on interpreting the results of
tests and correlating those results with outcome. Given that a
false positive test for unfavorable neurological outcome could
lead to inappropriate withdrawal of life support from a pa-
tient who otherwise would have recovered, specificity is the
most important test characteristic when predicting unfavor-
able outcome. In some instances, prognostication and with-
drawal of life support may appropriately occur earlier because
of nonneurologic disease, catastrophic brain herniation, pa-
tient’s goals and wishes, or clearly nonsurvivable situations.
Many of the tests considered are subject to error because of
the effects of medications, organ dysfunction, and tempera-
ture. Importantly, many published neuroprognostic studies
are impacted by self-fulfilling prophecy bias, given that prac-
tices of neuroprognostication are inherently part of PCAC,
and in turn, outcomes are modulated by such practices. Fur-
thermore, research studies have methodological limitations,
including small sample sizes, single-center design, lack of
```
blinding, failure (or inability) to account for unmeasured fac-
```
tors that impact the pace of recovery, and the use of outcome
at hospital discharge rather than a time point associated with
```
maximal recovery (typically 3–6 months after arrest).3 Addi-
```
tionally, prognostic tests may yield discordant or inconclusive
results, and in such instances, continued observation and se-
rial assessment remains a treatment option.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. Any single method of neuroprognostication has
an intrinsic error rate and may be subject to
confounding, therefore, multiple modalities should
be used to improve decision-making accuracy. 4–9
The overall certainty in the evidence of neuroprog-
nostication studies is low due to inherent biases
that limit the internal validity of studies and limited
generalizability that challenge their external validity.
Neuroprognostication approaches employing mul-
```
timodal testing aim at mitigating error rates; con-
```
cordant results increase certainty when predicting
outcomes.3,5,6,8,10–19
2. Early withdrawal of life support based on presumed
poor neurological prognosis remains frequent,
despite the risk for unreliable outcome prediction
within 72 hours after ROSC.20,21 Sedatives and neu-
romuscular blockers may be metabolized more slowly
in post–cardiac arrest patients, and injured brains
may be more sensitive to the depressant effects of
various medications. Residual sedation or paralysis
can confound the accuracy of clinical examinations.22
3. Establishing clear and cohesive communica-
tion with families is a key aspect of PCAC.
Communication should be implemented early and
maintained longitudinally, addressing major needs,
including the uncertainty of neurological progno-
sis.23,24 Difficulties in family-team communication
dynamics may contribute to premature withdrawal
of life support.25 Discordance in goals of care
between clinicians and families/surrogates has
been reported in more than 25% of critically ill
patients.26 Regular multidisciplinary meetings may
help improve communication.
4. Operationally, the timing for prognostic impressions
is typically at least 5 days after ROSC for patients
treated with hypothermic temperature control
```
(approximately 72 hours after normothermia) and
```
is conducted under conditions that minimize the
confounding effects of sedating medications. Each
neuroprognostic test has a specific time window in
which it has optimal test performance. Prognostic
impressions comprise results of tests integrated
into the multimodality assessment synthesized at
least 72 hours after normothermia. 11,13,27–35
Use of the Clinical Examination in
Neuroprognostication
Synopsis
Historically, neuroprognostic studies evaluated findings
from clinical examination that correlated with unfavor-
able neurological outcome. More recently, the focus of
neuroprognostication after cardiac arrest has shifted
to include prognostication for both favorable and unfa-
vorable outcome. Given that a test may perform better
in predicting unfavorable but not favorable outcome or
vice versa, specific recommendations are made depend-
```
ing on the finding and the outcome (ie, favorable versus

1. Twenty-seven retrospective studies demonstrated
that absent pupillary light reflex evaluated imme-
diately after ROSC and up to 7 days after arrest
predicted unfavorable neurological outcome with
```
specificity ranging from 48% to 100%5–8,11,27,28,38–57;
```
these studies support the reliability of pupillary
light reflex as a prognostic tool.4,58,59 Studies with
earlier time points for assessments of pupillary
```
light reflex had lower specificity43,46; the highest
```
specificity was seen at time points ≥72 hours after
arrest5,6,8,11,40,42 and when combined with absent cor-
neal reflexes.5,7,8,42 The false positive rates of bilaterally
absent pupillary light reflex when assessed at least
72 hours after arrest in predicting unfavorable out-
come were consistently low across studies. However,
pupillary light reflex is vulnerable to the effect of med-
ications and ambient light, subjective interpretation of
the examiner, rigor of technique for assessment, indi-
vidual factors, and self-fulfilling prophecy bias.
2. Quantitative pupillary light reflex of 0% is an objec-
tive finding that describes bilateral absence of
pupillary light reflex as assessed by pupillometry. 49
The automated quantification of pupillary reactivity
with pupillometry yields measurements of ampli-
tude and velocity of constriction and dilatation. Four
retrospective studies evaluated quantitative pupil-
```
lary light response (ie, the percentage of reaction
```
```
to light),49,60–62 and 9 evaluated NPi (reactivity index
```
```
from comparison with normal responses)13,18,49,62–67
```
at time points ranging from immediately after
ROSC65 to 72 hours after arrest. Quantitative
responses of 4% to 5% had higher sensitivity in
predicting unfavorable neurologic outcome within
72 hours after arrest while maintaining 100%
specificity. The NPi ≤2 threshold at 24 hours dem-
onstrated 100% specificity for unfavorable neuro-
logical outcome in most studies. 13,18,49,66,67 NPi is
```
nonspecific and may be affected by medications;
```
thus, an absolute NPi cutoff that predicts unfavor-
able outcome remains unknown.4,13,18,49,59,62–67
3. Eighteen studies evaluated the bilateral absence
of corneal reflexes at time points ranging from
immediately after ROSC to 7 days after arrest
with specificity ranging from 25% to 100%5,7,8,27–
```
29,35,40,42–45,48,50,53,54,68,69; these studies support the
```
reliability of corneal reflex as a prognostic tool.
Studies with higher specificity evaluated corneal
reflexes at time points ≥72 hours after arrest or
in combination with bilaterally absent pupillary light
reflexes.5,7,8,42 Corneal reflexes are subject to con-
founding by medications and rigor of technique of
the examiner, and few studies specifically evalu-
ated the potential of residual medication effect or
described the type of stimuli used for testing.
4. Marked heterogeneity in study definition of myoclo-
nus after cardiac arrest challenge the interpretation of
this finding as a neuroprognostic tool.70 Eleven obser-

94% to 100%.6,7,33,53,71,72 There were methodological
limitations in all studies, including a lack of standard
definitions, lack of blinding, incomplete data on EEG
correlates, and the inability to differentiate between
myoclonus subtypes. This imprecision may result
in erroneous estimates of unfavorable outcome if
undifferentiated myoclonus is used as a prognostic
marker. Given these limitations in the interpretation
of literature and the need for characterization of
electroclinical subtypes of myoclonus after cardiac
arrest, an expert consensus suggested avoiding
using the term status myoclonus.73
5. Historically, the best motor examination in the
upper extremities has been used as a prognos-
tic tool, with extensor or absent motor responses
being correlated with unfavorable outcome.
Previous literature was limited by methodologi-
cal concerns, including confounding for effects of
hypothermic temperature control and medications,
as well as self-fulfilling prophecy bias. The litera-
ture was so imprecise with higher-than-acceptable
```
false positive rates (up to 75.1%) 4,7,58,59 that the
```
finding of absent or extensor response as best
motor response was considered potentially harm-
ful when used alone for predicting a unfavorable
neurological outcome.74 Conversely, multimodal
neuroprognostic studies using the Glasgow Coma
Motor subscore as an entry point have demon-
strated sensitivity ranging from 23% to 71% while
maintaining high specificity.5–9

Synopsis
Serum biomarkers are blood-based tests that measure
the concentration of proteins normally found in the central
nervous system. These proteins are absorbed into blood
in the setting of neurological injury, and their serum levels
reflect the degree of brain injury. Limitations to their prog-
nostic utility include variability in testing methods on the
basis of site and laboratory, between-laboratory incon-
sistency in levels, susceptibility to additional uncertainty
due to hemolysis, and potential extracerebral sources of
the proteins. The 2020 and 2022 ILCOR systematic re-
views evaluated studies that obtained serum biomarkers
within the first 7 days after arrest and correlated serum
biomarker concentrations with favorable and unfavorable
neurological outcomes.4,37 Other testing of serum bio-
markers, including testing levels over serial time points
after arrest, was not evaluated. The 2 most studied bio-
markers were NSE and S100 calcium-binding protein B
```
(S100B). Additional evidence for NfL in predicting fa-
```
vorable neurological outcomes and levels of other blood
biomarkers for predicting favorable neurological out-
comes has accumulated since these reviews. Prospec-
tive validation of different biomarkers and thresholds for
both favorable and unfavorable neurological outcome in
cohorts more broadly representative of resuscitated car-
diac arrest patients is of high clinical importance.

a broad range of thresholds needed to achieve
100% specificity, and imprecision. Data from only
2 observational studies assessing NfL for unfavor-
able outcome prediction were included in the 2020
ILCOR systematic review. 87,88 In the interim, 9 addi-
tional observational studies evaluated NfL within
72 hours after arrest for predicting unfavorable out-
come.81,82,89–95 Multiple studies directly compared
NfL to NSE for prognostication of unfavorable
outcome and found both improved sensitivity with
NfL while maintaining high specificity. Many of the
included studies are secondary analyses of RCTs.
Strengths of these studies include multiple sites,
blinding of clinical staff, and standardized, blinded
outcome assessment, but the trial populations may
not reflect the overall post–cardiac arrest popula-
```
tion. SIMOA (Quanterix) was the most used assay.
```
Values may differ among commercially available
assays. 96 Studies reported multiple thresholds and
collected samples at different times. In the postar-
rest period, the optimal threshold and timing for
both NSE and NfL levels are unknown, but very
high levels may inform multimodal prognostication.
2. For predicting favorable outcome, the 2022 sys-
tematic review identified normal levels of NSE
```
(<17 μg/L) between 24 and 72 hours as a predic-
```
tor of favorable neurological outcome. 37 Specificity
was >80% in the included studies. The biomarkers
S100B, NfL, ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase-
```
L1 (UCH-L1), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP),
```
and tau were also included. NfL and GFAP had the
highest specificity for favorable outcome but had
relatively fewer studies compared with NSE. Interval
searches identified 5 studies of NSE,8,16,76,97,98 1 of
NfL,90 and 1 of both GFAP and tau 99 for predict-
ing favorable neurological outcome. Specificity for
favorable neurological outcome was >80% for
each biomarker. Different threshold values and
sample timing were reported between studies.
While the evidence for favorable outcome predic-
tion with biomarkers is less established than for
prediction of unfavorable outcome, sustained low
levels of biomarkers, in particular, NSE, may be
an encouraging finding. Specificity may be lower
when predicting favorable neurological outcome
due to competing risks of nonneurological organ
dysfunction or failure.
3. In addition to 2 prospective and 2 retrospective stud-
ies identified in the 2020 ILCOR systematic review,4
3 observational studies evaluated S100B levels
within the first 72 hours after arrest.84,85,93 The maxi-
mal level that correlated with unfavorable outcome
ranged broadly depending on the study and the tim-
ing when it was measured after arrest. Interval stud-
ies do not clarify the optimal timing or threshold value
to inform prognostication. Only 1 study of GFAP100
and tau101 were identified. Seven observational
studies investigated other biomarkers, including
UCH-L1, GFAP, and serum and cerebrospinal fluid
tau.89,93,95,99,102–104 In studies that included multiple
biomarkers, performance was not consistently bet-
ter than NSE. Given the low number of studies, the
certainty of evidence was low and these biomarkers
could not be recommended for clinical practice.

Hirsch et al Post–Cardiac Arrest Care: 2025 AHA Guidelines for CPR and ECC
Use of Electrophysiological Tests for
Neuroprognostication
Synopsis
Electroencephalography is widely used in clinical
practice to evaluate cortical brain activity and diag-
nose seizures. Its use as a neuroprognostic tool for
predicting both unfavorable and favorable neurologi-
cal outcome is promising, but the literature is limited
by several factors, including lack of standardized ter-
minology and definitions, relatively small sample sizes,
lack of blinding, subjectivity in the interpretation, and
lack of accounting for effects of medications. There
is also inconsistency in definitions used to describe
specific findings and patterns. The EEG patterns that
were evaluated in the 2020 ILCOR systematic review
for predicting unfavorable neurological outcome in-
clude unreactive EEG, epileptiform discharges, sei-
zures, status epilepticus, burst suppression, and “highly
malignant” EEG. 4 Unfortunately, studies define “highly
malignant” EEG differently or imprecisely, limiting use
of this finding. Use of standardized terminology from
the ACNS avoids this heterogeneity and limits poten-
tial for misclassification. Several EEG patterns were
observed in a 2022 systematic review for predicting
favorable neurological outcome. 37 While studies had
several operational definitions, most classifications
assessed EEG continuity, voltage, and absence of epi-
leptiform discharges.
```
Somatosensory-evoked potentials (SSEPs) evaluate
```
the integrity of the dorsal column–lemniscal sensory
pathway and are subject to less interference from medi-
cations than other modalities. In the context of neuro-
prognostication after cardiac arrest, SSEPs are obtained
by stimulating the median nerve and evaluating for the
presence of cortical N20 potentials, which are gener-
ated in the primary somatosensory cortex and demon-
strate integrity of the thalamocortical pathway involved
in cortical arousal and consciousness. The reliability of
this modality is limited by technical challenges, includ-
ing operator skill, interrater agreement, and impairment
of signal to noise ratio from muscle and environmental
contamination. Recommended technical standards are
available. 105

Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. No additional studies have been identified since the
publication of the 2020 ILCOR systematic review. 4
The 2020 systematic review included observa-
tional studies focused on electrographic seizures,
though some studies also included convulsive sei-
zures and the definitions for seizures were non-
standardized across studies. The specificity of
unequivocal seizures meeting ACNS critical care
```
EEG criteria was 100%; however, the sensitivity
```
```
of this finding was poor (0.3%–26.8%), and other
```
studies that were not included in the review found
patients with postarrest seizures who had favor-
able outcomes. 31,106,107 Additional methodological
concerns include selection bias for which patients
underwent EEG monitoring and inconsistent defi-
nitions of seizure. Further, critical care EEG termi-
nology has been updated since the publication of
these studies.108 The term seizure encompasses
a broad spectrum of pathologies that likely have
different prognoses, ranging from a single brief
electrographic seizure to refractory status epilep-
ticus, and this imprecision justifies the more limited
recommendation.
2. In the 2020 ILCOR systematic review, the speci-
ficity of status epilepticus for unfavorable out-
come ranged from 82.6% to 100%.4 No additional
studies were identified that reported sensitivity or
specificity of this finding. One retrospective study

reported electrographic characteristics of patients
with definitive or possible status epilepticus.109
Of the 64 subjects included, 5 survived 30 days
after arrest and 1 had a favorable outcome. The
most common cause of death in decedents was
withdrawal of life-sustaining therapies, which
```
occurred a median of 8 days (IQR, 7–11) after
```
arrest. Interestingly, although status epilepticus is
a severe form of seizure the specificity of status
epilepticus for unfavorable outcome was less than
reported in the studies examining the seizures
```
overall (as above). Additional concerns within the
```
studies include the inconsistent definition of status
epilepticus, lack of blinding, and the use of status
epilepticus to justify withdrawal of life-sustaining
therapies leading to potential self-fulfilling prophe-
cies. The 72-hour timing is based on most studies
reporting presence of status epilepticus within this
period and case reports of good outcome when
status epilepticus is successfully treated within this
period.
3. The term highly malignant EEG was inconsis-
tently applied in studies included in the 2020
ILCOR systematic review.4 Twelve studies evalu-
ated burst suppression or suppression on EEG
monitoring. 6,8,9,40,69,72,81,110–114 Across these studies,
highly malignant EEG was classified as burst sup-
pression or suppression according to the ACNS
critical care EEG terminology. 108,115 Specificity
ranged from 90.7% to 100%, and sensitivity was
15% to 51%. The potential for self-fulfilling proph-
ecies, interrater disagreement, and lack of control
for medication effects limited the ability to make a
stronger recommendation, despite the overall high
specificity. 112 Further, in a preplanned analysis of
the TTM2 trial, specificity of burst suppression or
suppression for unfavorable outcome was lower
```
(93%) compared to studies with specific central-
```
ized or expert EEG review.114 Additional studies
identifying subtypes of burst suppression, such
as synchronous or identical bursts, are needed. 116
Burst suppression can be caused by medications,
so it is particularly important that clinicians have
knowledge about the potential effects of medica-
tion on this prognostic tool.
4. The 2020 ILCOR systematic review considered
discharges as either rhythmic/periodic or nonrhyth-
mic/periodic.4 Sensitivity and specificity of rhyth-
mic/periodic patterns for unfavorable outcome
ranged from 0.5% to 50.8% and 77.7% to 100%,
respectively, with wide confidence intervals. As
the time from the cardiac arrest to test increased,
the specificity of rhythmic/periodic discharges
for unfavorable outcome improved. Nonrhythmic/
periodic patterns had a similar range of sensitiv-
```
ity (0.5%–38.5%) and specificity (84.6%–100%).
```
One observational study reported outcomes in
patients with stimulus-induced rhythmic or periodic
patterns recorded >36 hours after arrest.117 Of the
```
142 included patients, 20 (14%) had stimulus-
```
induced rhythmic or periodic patterns recorded on
EEG monitoring. The rate of unfavorable outcome
```
was not different between patients with (n=13,
```
```
65%) or without stimulus induced rhythmic or peri-
```
```
odic patterns (n=88, 72%) (P=0.596). The litera-
```
ture of both rhythmic/periodic and nonrhythmic/
periodic discharges are limited by lack of account-
ing for effects of medications and variable timing
of EEG monitoring. Low specificity currently limits
the use of these findings to support an unfavorable
prognosis.
5. Bilateral absence of N20 peaks following
median nerve stimulation is the most stud-
ied and well-accepted neuroprognostic pre-
dictor for SSEP testing. Twenty observational
studies 5–8,11–13,27,35,38,39,41–43,47,49,50,55,57,69,72,118–130
evaluated bilateral absent N20 peaks assessed
up to 6 days after arrest with specificity ranging
from 50% to 100%. Six studies had specificity
below 100%, 11,27,47,50,118,123 and additional method-
ological limitations included lack of blinding and
potential for self-fulfilling prophecy bias. Newer
studies evaluated the unilateral absence of N20
combined with amplitude thresholds, which may
increase sensitivity for detection of unfavorable
outcome.6,57,131,132 While studies evaluated SSEPs
obtained at any time starting immediately after
ROSC, there is a high likelihood of potential con-
founding factors early after cardiac arrest, leading
to the recommendation that SSEPs should only be
obtained >48 hours after arrest.
6. A preplanned analysis of the TTM2 trial data
reported the prognostic value of unreactive EEG
between 24 hours to 14 days. 114 Specificity for
unfavorable neurological outcome was 60% with
a sensitivity of 79%. The study relied on local EEG
reviewers to assess reactivity rather than a cen-
tralized expert review. Specificity was lower than in
studies included in the 2020 ILCOR review, which
ranged from 41.7% to 100% but was below 90%
in most studies.4 One study assessed EEG reactiv-
ity during hypothermia and normothermia intending
to assess agreement for reactivity between raters
and sensitivity for unfavorable outcome for reactiv-
ity to different stimulations. 35 Percent agreement
ranged from 58% to 70%, and sensitivity ranged
from 52% to 86% depending on stimulation type
and whether assessment occurred during hypo-
thermia or normothermia. Thus, the overall cer-
tainty of the evidence was rated as very low. There
is interest in automated reactivity assessment and
stimulation paradigms.

Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. The 2022 systematic review for prediction of favorable
outcome found a continuous EEG background with-
out discharges within 72 hours after cardiac arrest to
predict a favorable neurological outcome.37 Specificity
ranged from 51% to 100%, with most studies report-
ing a specificity >80%. Specificity was higher in ear-
```
lier (12 and 24 hours) compared to later time points
```
```
(48 and 72 hours). One additional observational study
```
evaluated continuous normal voltage background
without discharges on EEG 24 hours after cardiac
arrest.16 Sensitivity and specificity for favorable neu-
rological outcome at 6 months after arrest were 64%
and 89%, respectively. When compared to unfavor-
able outcome, the specificity for predicting favorable
outcome is overall less given the competing risk of
nonneurological mortality and morbidity.
2. Quantitative characteristics of the N20 signal are of
interest as prognostic indicators, and there are sev-
eral methods for calculating the amplitude of the N20
wave. The threshold of >4 μV when measured as the
peak-to-trough difference between the peak of the
N20 wave and the trough of the subsequent P25
wave has achieved specificity above 90% with sensi-
tivity above 40% in most studies using this finding to
predict favorable neurological outcome.16,36,37,72 One
study found that patients sedated with midazolam
```
had lower amplitudes (measured as N20/P25 peak-
```
```
to-peak amplitude) when compared to propofol.14
```
The ideal amplitude thresholds, measurement meth-
ods, and timing of N20 wave amplitude testing for
SSEP that predict favorable outcome is unknown.
Use of Neuroimaging for Neuroprognostication
Synopsis
Neuroimaging may be helpful to detect and quantify struc-
tural brain injury after cardiac arrest. The most common
```
modalities are CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
```
The use of quantitative analysis modalities assessing the
burden of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury in clinical practice
is limited by the availability of quantitative methods outside
research settings, while qualitative imaging results are of-
ten subjective and have lower sensitivity.133,134 On CT, cy-
totoxic brain edema can be quantified as the gray-white
```
ratio (GWR), defined as the ratio between the density
```
```
(measured as Hounsfield units) of gray matter and white
```
matter. Normal brain has a GWR of approximately 1.3. In
the setting of cerebral edema, GWR declines, either due to
```
decreased density of gray matter (representing cytotoxic
```
```
edema) or decreased attenuation of white matter. On MRI,
```
cytotoxic brain edema can be measured as restricted dif-
```
fusion on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and can be
```
```
quantified by the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). The
```
ADC is a sensitive measure of injury, with normal values
ranging between 650 and 1000 × 10−6 mm2/s and val-
ues decreasing with injury. Brain injury findings from CT
and MRI evolve over the first several days after arrest, so
the timing of the imaging study of interest is particularly
important as it relates to prognosis.

Thirty-four of the studies evaluated CT obtained
within 24 hours after arrest, 6,17,55,56,68,121,133–139,141–143,
145,147–153,155,156,158–161,163–166 and 6 studies
included brain CTs obtained up to 10 days after
arrest. 125,140,146,154,157,162 In retrospective studies, the
predictive performance improved when images
were obtained at 24 to 72 hours134,140,151,155 and
up to 10 days from ROSC.154,162 There were meth-
odological limitations, including selection bias, risk
of multiple comparisons, and heterogeneity of
measurement techniques, such as anatomic sites,
equipment, and calculation methods. Thus, spe-
cific methods for calculation of and thresholds for
GWR and ideal timing for CT acquisition that pre-
dict unfavorable prognosis with highest specificity
remain unknown. Fewer studies have evaluated
CT metrics as predictors of death by neurological
```
criteria 148,150; external validation and reproducibility
```
of methods are lacking.
2. Ten observational studies 16,55,69,110,168–173 investi-
gated DWI changes on MRI qualitatively within 2 to
7 days after arrest for unfavorable outcome predic-
tion. The studies evaluated MRI qualitatively. And
definitions of relevant findings differed between
studies, such as use of “high signal intensity” and
“positive findings.” In some studies, only specific
brain regions were examined, with or without using
a standardized scoring system. Moreover, stud-
ies are limited by subjective thresholds and lack
of blinding. The specificity ranged from 55.7% to
100%. In the context of multimodal prognostica-
tion, an extensive burden of reduced DWI on MRI
may be correlated with unfavorable prognosis, but
a broader recommendation could not be supported.
The imprecise definition and short-term outcome
in some studies led to significant uncertainty about
how to use qualitative DWI MRI to predict unfavor-
able prognosis.
3. Ten observational studies investigated quantitative
ADC on MRI within 2 to 7 days after arrest for unfa-
vorable prognosis prediction.17,69,158,164,170,171,174–177
The studies used custom-made computational
tools to quantitatively determine the whole brain
or region of interest volume below a specific ADC
threshold for poor outcome prediction. The ADC
thresholds used, ADC calculation methods used,
and regions included for analyses varied among
studies, with cutoffs for unfavorable outcome with
100% specificity using 650 × 10−6 mm2/s or
450 × 10−6 mm2/s varying from 20.5% to 42.2%
and 1.3% to 5.2%, respectively. There is no stan-
dardization of quantitative measurements of ADC in
cardiac arrest, and such analyses require expertise
```
in advanced computational methods; hence, there
```
are concerns about feasibility and reliability. In the
context of multimodal prognostication, an extensive
burden of decreased ADC on MRI may be corre-
lated with unfavorable prognosis. A specific ADC
threshold for global or regional brain injury that pre-
dicts unfavorable prognosis is not known.

ORGAN DONATION AFTER CARDIAC
ARREST IN ADULTS
Recommendations for Organ Donation After Cardiac Arrest in Adults
COR LOE Recommendations
1 B-NR
1. Organ donation should be considered in all adult
patients resuscitated from cardiac arrest who meet
```
neurological criteria for death (ie, brain death).
```
1 B-NR
2. Organ donation should be considered in all adult
patients resuscitated from cardiac arrest before
planned withdrawal of life-sustaining therapies.
1 C-EO 3. Decisions about organ donation should followlocal legal and regulatory requirements.
1 C-EO
4. Organ donation is an important outcome that
should be considered in the development and
evaluation of systems of care.
2b C-LD
5. It may be reasonable to consider utilization of
organs from adult patients resuscitated with
ECPR who remain supported on ECMO and
```
who meet neurological criteria for death (ie, brain
```
```
death) or for whom withdrawal of life-sustaining
```
therapies is planned.
Synopsis
Organ transplantation wait times in the United States
are increasing as patients in need of transplant outpace
available organs. 1 Thousands die annually waiting for
transplantation. 1 Patients with cardiac arrest make up
an important pool of potential donors because cardiac
arrest is common and a substantial proportion of those
who cannot recover are still able to donate. 2–7 However,
organ donation is rarely reported as an outcome in car-
diac arrest clinical trials or as a metric in large registry
data.
Deceased organ donation may occur after death
```
is determined by neurological criteria (donation after
```
```
brain death) or circulatory criteria (donation after circu-
```
```
latory death [DCD]). After sudden cardiac arrest, DCD
```
can be pursued in patients with ROSC after planned
withdrawal of life-sustaining therapies and the transi-
tion to comfort- oriented care, called controlled DCD,
or in patients who fail to achieve ROSC after unsuc-
cessful resuscitation, called uncontrolled DCD. Uncon-
trolled DCD has unique logistic, ethical, and legal
requirements—factors that hinder its widespread appli-
cation in many settings.
The role of extracorporeal membrane support in
organ donors is complex and evolving. Patients with car-
diac arrest may receive extracorporeal membrane sup-
port either through ECPR or through having it placed
in the postarrest period. Those patients who remain
on extracorporeal membrane support and die by brain
death or have a planned withdrawal of life-sustaining
therapies represent a unique population of potential
organ donors.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1, 2. Numerous observational studies demonstrate that
allograft function and recipient outcomes are simi-
lar when transplanted organs are recovered from
patients with cardiac arrest compared with other
```
deceased donors8–14; this holds true for donation
```
after brain death and controlled DCD.
3. Laws and regulations governing the determination
of death and organ donation vary not only between
countries15,16 but also by state despite efforts to
standardize death determined by neurological cri-
teria worldwide. 15

Hirsch et al Post–Cardiac Arrest Care: 2025 AHA Guidelines for CPR and ECC
4. A 2023 ILCOR CoSTR scientific statement
focuses on the importance of increasing organ
availability after cardiac arrest. 7 It recognizes
organ donation as an important outcome of car-
diac arrest and emphasizes the importance of
research and clinical protocols incorporating this
principle. Organ donation after cardiac arrest
directly benefits recipient patients.
5. A 2024 meta-analysis 17 based mostly on retro-
spective observational studies, case reports, and
one retrospective analysis of a prospective trial18
demonstrated that organs donated from patients
who were already on extracorporeal membrane
support were viable for transplantation. In a subset
of patients receiving ECPR, graft survival was high,
reaching 89%. The most common organ donated
was kidney, followed by liver and heart. The included
studies indicate that patients who received ECPR
are a potential source of donor organs and that
organs donated from patients who received ECPR
can have good graft survival.

RECOVERY AND SURVIVORSHIP AFTER
CARDIAC ARREST
Recommendations for Recovery and Survivorship After Cardiac Arrest
COR LOE Recommendations
1 B-R
1. It is recommended that cardiac arrest survivors
and their caregivers have structured assessment
and treatment/referral for emotional distress after
medical stabilization and before hospital dis-
charge.
1 C-LD
2. It is recommended that cardiac arrest survivors
have multimodal rehabilitation assessment and
treatment for cognitive, physical, neurological, and
cardiopulmonary impairments before hospital dis-
charge.
1 C-LD
3. It is recommended that cardiac arrest survivors
and their caregivers have multidisciplinary dis-
charge planning, to include medical and rehabili-
tative treatment recommendations and return to
activity/work expectations.
2b B-R 4. Interventions to address health care professionalburnout may be beneficial.
2b C-LD
5. Debriefings and referral for follow-up for emotional
support for lay rescuers, emergency medical
services professionals, and hospital-based health
care professionals after a cardiac arrest event may
be beneficial.
Synopsis
Survivors of cardiac arrest experience emotional, social,
physical, neurological, and cognitive sequalae, which can
manifest during or after hospitalization.1,2 Broadly defined,
survivorship is the journey from stabilization through re-
habilitation, recovery, and societal reintegration. 1 Improv-
ing cardiac arrest survivorship involves families, health

care partners, and communities. Caregivers of cardiac
arrest survivors also experience emotional and social
challenges as they navigate survivorship issues.1,2
Optimizing survivorship for survivors and their caregiv-
ers involves in-hospital screening, treatment, referral, and
postdischarge surveillance of postarrest sequalae.1 Sur-
vivorship plans given at discharge can provide direction
by including a summary of the inpatient course, individu-
alized medical and rehabilitative treatment recommen-
dations, and postdischarge recovery expectations.1
All those impacted by cardiac arrest can be powerful
advocates for informing community responses to car-
diac arrest, tailored interventions, and relevant patient-/
family-centered outcomes.1
Finally, lay rescuers, emergency medical services pro-
fessionals, and hospital-based health care professionals
who care for cardiac arrest patients often experience
distress.3,4 Debriefings after witnessing cardiac arrest
events, identifying the natural stressors associated with
caring for such patients, and offering well-being inter-
ventions or referrals for follow-up mental health ser-
vices may provide opportunities to mitigate distress and
burnout.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. Approximately one fourth of cardiac arrest survi-
vors and their caregivers experience emotional
```
distress (including anxiety, depression, and post-
```
```
traumatic stress).1,5–8 Fatigue is also common and
```
may be related to distress and physical and cogni-
tive symptoms.2,9–11 Often, these symptoms begin
to manifest during hospitalization and can linger
from months to years.7,9,10
One RCT compared a psychosocial intervention
```
between 2 groups; both groups included survivor-
```
caregiver pairs, but in one group, only the survi-
vors received the psychosocial intervention and in
the other group, both the survivors and caregivers
received the psychosocial intervention.12,13 There
were improvements in emotional distress for the
```
survivors in both groups; however, those in the
```
survivor-caregiver intervention group had the great-
est benefit. Caregivers in the survivor-caregiver
intervention group had more improvements in
caregiver burden compared with the caregivers
in the survivor-only intervention group.12,13 Two
other RCTs in survivors showed improvements in
emotional distress in those receiving psychosocial
intervention compared with control. 14–16 The evalu-
ation before discharge is important to facilitate
care coordination and referral.
2. Cognitive impairments, particularly in memory, atten-
tion, and executive function, are common in cardiac
arrest survivors.17–19 Physical, neurological, and car-
diopulmonary impairments are also prevalent.10,20–23
One RCT found improved quality of life in survivors
enrolled in an early, cognitive-focused screening,
self-management, and referral program compared
to treatment as usual.24 Three other preliminary tri-
als demonstrated feasibility of a residential physi-
cal rehabilitation intervention, cardiac rehabilitation,
and a telephone-based occupational therapy inter-
vention in cardiac arrest survivors, with preliminary
benefits in physical, cardiopulmonary, and quality
of life outcomes.25–27 The evaluation prior to dis-
charge is important to facilitate care coordination
and referral.
3. Community reintegration and return to work or
other daily activities may be slow and depend on
availability of social support and degree of postar-
rest sequelae.27–31 Survivors and caregivers need
direction on managing their postarrest challenges
```
(eg, guidance on possibility of experiencing psy-
```
chological, cognitive, physical, neurological, and
cardiopulmonary symptoms and which profession-
```
als to seek out should they arise) and returning to
```
daily activities.1,2
4. Burnout among health care professionals is com-
mon,32 is not unique to those who provide care for
patients with cardiac arrest, and is often character-
ized by emotional exhaustion, depersonalization/
cynicism, and reduced sense of personal accom-
plishment. 33 Burnout negatively impacts health
```
care professionals’ productivity (eg, absenteeism,
```
```
turnover) and patient care (eg, reduced patient
```
```
satisfaction and increased clinician errors). 34,35
```
Seven RCTs targeting burnout in health care
professionals all led to some improvement in at
least one dimension of burnout or mental health
outcome. Intervention mechanisms varied consid-
erably, including yoga, mindfulness, gratitude jour-
naling, various other positive psychology exercises,
and individualized professional coaching. Benefits
included improved well-being, work engagement,
quality of life, perceived stress, and depressive and
anxiety symptoms.36–42
Although these results are promising, variability
in intervention methods and outcome measures,
considerable attrition, and high risk of bias inher-
ent in behavioral trials limit the degree to which
any single well-being intervention method can be
recommended.
5. Rescuers and hospital-based health care profes-
sionals may experience emotional distress caring
for a cardiac arrest patient.3,4,43,44 Team debriefings
may allow for quality improvement as well as rec-
ognition of the natural stressors associated with
caring for a cardiac arrest patient. In one qualita-
tive study of lay rescuers and one nonrandomized
study of emergency department professionals,
participants reported benefitting emotionally from
