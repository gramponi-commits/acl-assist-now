ABSTRACT: In these guidelines, the American Heart Association provides updated guidance for resuscitation of adults and
```
children in cardiac arrest or with a life-threatening condition due to special circumstances, including anaphylaxis, asthma,
cardiac arrest in the cardiac intervention suite, cardiac arrest following cardiac surgery, drowning, electrocution, gas embolism,
high-consequence respiratory pathogens, hyperkalemia, hyperthermia, hypothermia, left ventricular assist device failure,
pregnancy, pulmonary embolism, and poisoning due to benzodiazepines, β-blockers, calcium channel blockers, cocaine, cyanide,
digoxin and related cardiac glycosides, local anesthetic systemic toxicity, methemoglobinemia, opioids, organophosphates
and carbamates, sodium channel blockers, sympathomimetics, and volatile hydrocarbons. Recommendations are also
provided for alternatives to cardiopulmonary resuscitation and the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for poisoned
patients. Adults and children with these conditions require modification of basic life support and advanced life support. These
guidelines are based on systematic evidence reviews and provide separate graded recommendations for adults and children.

TOP 10 TAKE-HOME MESSAGES
FOR SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES OF
RESUSCITATION
1. Anaphylaxis: Isotonic intravenous (IV) fluids may be
used for fluid resuscitation in cardiac arrest from
anaphylaxis, whereas standard anaphylaxis dose of
epinephrine administered via autoinjector or intra-
muscularly may not offer benefit. Glucagon may
be reasonable to administer in cases refractory to
standard treatment when β-blocker exposure is
suspected. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation
```
(ECMO) is reasonable in refractory cases.
```
2. Cardiac interventional laboratory: Some adults
in cardiac arrest in the cardiac interventional
laboratory may require specialized interventions,
including performing a corrective procedure to
treat the etiology of the arrest, mechanical cardio-
```
pulmonary resuscitation (CPR), extracorporeal life
```
```
support (ECLS), or intracoronary epinephrine.
```
3. ECLS: While ECLS is not available in every setting,
adults and children in cardiac arrest or a peri-arrest
state with a potentially reversible etiology may be
supported with ECLS devices, such as venoarterial
```
ECMO (VA-ECMO), in disease processes such as
```
anaphylaxis, asthma, cardiac surgery, cardiac interven-
tional laboratory, hypothermia, and pulmonary embo-
```
lism (PE) and in poisonings like β-blockers, calcium
```
```
channel blockers (CCBs), cocaine, local anesthetics,
```
sodium channel blockers, and sympathomimetics.

```
Cao et al Special Circumstances: 2025 AHA Guidelines for CPR and ECC
4. High-consequence respiratory pathogen: Chest
compressions, bag-mask ventilation, defibrillation,
suctioning, and endotracheal intubation should be
considered aerosol-generating procedures, which
pose a risk of infection to resuscitation team mem-
bers. However, a real-world study found that rates
of severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus
```
2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission to resuscitation
```
team members using personal protective equip-
```
ment (PPE) were low.
```
5. Hyperkalemia: Clinical evidence supporting
IV calcium or IV sodium bicarbonate admin-
istration is limited in humans and uncertain to
improve survival or favorable neurological out-
comes. The utility of other therapies intended
to lower potassium concentrations in the set-
ting of cardiac arrest is unclear when weighing
their possible benefits against the risk of harm if
well-established interventions, such as CPR, are
interrupted.
6. Hyperthermia: Adults and children with life-
threatening hyperthermia from environmental
causes, cocaine poisoning, or sympathomimetic
poisoning should be rapidly cooled, ideally at a rate
```
of at least 0.15 °C/min (0.27 °F/min). This is best
```
achieved with immersion in ice water.
7. Hypothermia: Adults and children with life-
threatening environmental hypothermia may sur-
vive with good neurological outcomes even after
prolonged cardiac arrest. Patients should be
rewarmed concurrently with resuscitation efforts.
ECLS can be used where available.
8. Left ventricular assist device (LVAD): The absence
of a palpable pulse can make confirming cardiac
arrest in adults and children with an LVAD diffi-
```
cult; thus perfusion is assessed using skin color,
```
skin temperature, capillary refill, mean arterial
pressure, and partial pressure of end-tidal carbon
dioxide. Treatment includes prioritization of CPR
while simultaneously assessing and attempting
to restart LVAD function if a second rescuer is
available.
9. Pregnancy: Management of cardiac arrest dur-
ing pregnancy is a complex clinical scenario that
requires resuscitation strategies that accommo-
date for the physiological changes of pregnancy.
Resuscitation priorities include early airway man-
agement and left lateral uterine displacement.
10. Opioids: An opioid antagonist (eg, naloxone)
should be given to people with respiratory arrest
from suspected opioid overdose. Trained rescuers,
lay rescuers, and members of the general public
can all administer naloxone. During resuscitation of
cardiac arrest due to presumed opioid overdose, an
opioid antagonist may be reasonable to administer
if high-quality CPR is not interrupted.
PREAMBLE
The chain of survival is a series of steps in the process of
cardiac arrest management that begins with prevention
and concludes with survivorship. Throughout, coordinated
efforts are required of laypeople and health care profes-
sionals in a variety of disciplines across the health care
system. These guidelines contain recommendations for
```
basic life support (BLS) and advanced life support (ALS)
```
for adults and children in special circumstances resulting
in cardiac arrest and are based on the best available re-
suscitation science. For these recommendations, children
are defined as those without signs of puberty in the BLS
setting and those who are <18 years of age in the ALS
setting. Depending on the clinical data immediately avail-
able, there are numerous special circumstances in which
additional interventions or modifications to BLS and ALS
in adults and children may be required, spanning each
link in the chain of survival. Management of patients in
cardiac arrest from these special circumstances often
differs from standard resuscitation. For example, patients
may develop hypotension from β-adrenergic receptor
```
antagonist (eg, β-blocker) or calcium channel antagonist
```
```
(eg, CCB) poisoning that does not respond to atropine,
```
standard vasopressors, or cardiac pacing but is ame-
nable to targeted therapies, such as high-dose insulin.
In addition, specific recommendations about the training
of resuscitation professionals are provided in “Part 12:
Resuscitation Education Science” and recommendations
about systems of care are provided in “Part 4: Systems
of Care.”
INTRODUCTION
Scope of the Guidelines
These guidelines are designed primarily for North Ameri-
can health care professionals treating adults and chil-
dren in cardiac arrest or a life-threatening state from
a special circumstance requiring modification of BLS
and ALS. Life-threatening conditions include a range of
medical emergencies that pose an immediate risk to sur-
```
vival (eg, respiratory arrest, refractory hypotension, criti-
```
```
cal metabolic acidosis), while a cardiac arrest refers to
```
the cessation of cardiac output and, with that, cessation
of oxygen delivery throughout the body. Depending on
the data available, recommendations are made for the
management of patients in cardiac arrest or for patients
with life-threatening conditions inclusive of cardiac ar-
rest. Additionally, for certain topics, the relevant literature
regarding the management of cardiac arrest in these
settings may be limited to patients in a life-threatening
condition. The same therapies are recommended for life-
threatening conditions and cardiac arrest unless other-
wise stated.
These guidelines contain recommendations for BLS
and ALS for both adults and children. Unless otherwise

specified, the interventions recommended here are
intended for use in addition to standard BLS, pediat-
```
ric BLS, ALS, and pediatric ALS (PALS) resuscitation.
```
Although many of these treatments are impractical
outside of the hospital setting, several can be initiated
```
by emergency medical services and some (eg, giving
```
```
breaths to drowning victims) may be relevant to lay res-
```
cuers. These guidelines are intended to be used in con-
junction with topic-specific references and advice from
local and regional experts.
The special circumstances guidelines have historically
been developed from predominantly adult data. As is
common in pediatric medicine, these recommendations
were often applied to the resuscitation of children in
similar contexts. For the 2025 recommendations, the lit-
erature searches performed included all age groups, and
for which pediatric data are available, recommendations
were made in line with those data. For those where there
are sparse to no pediatric data, the recommendations will
be absent or extrapolated from adult data.
Throughout these guidelines, recommendations may
include therapies including procedures that all centers
are not sufficiently resourced to offer, such as ECLS,
hyperbaric oxygen therapy, and mechanical thrombec-
tomy. These therapies may, however, be available for
select centers and in those settings should be imple-
mented or considered depending on the strength of the
evidence and the clinical context. It is important for health
care professionals to follow their institutional guidelines
as well as the available literature.
Organization of the Writing Group
The writing group included a diverse group of experts with
backgrounds in emergency medicine, pediatric emergen-
cy medicine, adult and pediatric critical care, anesthesi-
ology, adult and pediatric cardiology, electrophysiology,
obstetrics and gynecology, maternal fetal medicine, hy-
perbaric medicine, medical toxicology, pharmacy, trauma
care, education, and research. Group members were ap-
```
pointed by the American Heart Association (AHA) Emer-
```
gency Cardiovascular Care Science Subcommittee. Each
recommendation was developed and formally approved
by the writing group and subsequently reviewed and ap-
proved by the AHA Emergency Cardiovascular Care Sci-
ence Subcommittee.
The AHA has rigorous conflict-of-interest policies
and procedures to minimize the risk of bias or improper
influence during the development of guidelines. Before
appointment, writing group members disclosed all rel-
evant commercial relationships and other potential
```
(including intellectual) conflicts. These procedures are
```
described more fully in “Part 2: Evidence Evaluation and
Guidelines Development” in the 2025 American Heart
Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation
and Emergency Cardiovascular Care. The Writing Group
Disclosures table at the end of this document lists the
writing group members’ relevant relationships with indus-
```
try (Appendix 1).
```
METHODOLOGY AND
EVIDENCE REVIEW
The writing group members first created and approved
a list of special circumstances topics, drawing on the
scope of prior guidelines and new topics that have gained
prominence since the 2020 publication. A population, in-
tervention, comparison, outcome, study design, and time
```
frame (PICOST) question was created for each topic.
```
Guided by the writing group chairs and with assistance
from a professional medical librarian as needed, the writ-
ing group performed a structured evidence evaluation
for each topic, which was internally peer reviewed. These
searches were executed in Medline and the Excerpta
```
Medica Database (Embase) using the Ovid search inter-
```
face, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled
Trials. International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation
```
(ILCOR) evidence reviews published since 2020 were
```
reviewed, and the dates of updated searches were har-
monized with these reviews to avoid search overlap. Fi-
nal complete searches were executed in July 2024 with
single database searches in November through Decem-
ber 2024. Structured searches were supplemented by
bibliography review and ad hoc searches when needed.
```
Search results were imported into Covidence (Covidence
```
systematic review software, Veritas Health Innovation,
```
Melbourne, Australia). At least 2 writing group members
```
performed dual screening of the titles and abstracts of
all articles identified from each search and identified
articles for full-text review. Screening conflicts were re-
solved between the 2 writing group members and writ-
ing group leadership before full-text review. Two writing
group members reviewed the full text of all selected ar-
ticles and applied the information contained to develop
treatment recommendations appropriate for each clinical
question. Each draft recommendation was created by a
group of 2 writing group members and then reviewed
and refined by all writing group members during regular
virtual meetings and 2 in-person meetings. Completed
draft recommendations were reviewed by organizational
leaders in the AHA with recommendations incorporated
as draft revisions. Final draft recommendations were
then externally peer reviewed. A more comprehensive
description of these methods is provided in “Part 2: Evi-
dence Evaluation and Guidelines Development.”

wording and the COR and LOE assignments. In deter-
mining the COR, the writing group considered the LOE
and other factors, including systems issues, economic
factors, and ethical factors, such as equity, acceptability,
feasibility, and risk of harm. These evidence review meth-
ods, including specific criteria used to determine COR
and LOE, are described more fully in “Part 2: Evidence
Evaluation and Guidelines Development” of the 2025
Guidelines.
Despite improvements in the design and funding sup-
port for emergency care research, the overall quality of
the evidence for special circumstances science is very
low. Only 2 of the 235 recommendations in these guide-
```
lines are supported by Level A evidence (high-quality
```
evidence from more than 1 randomized controlled trial
[RCT] or 1 or more RCTs corroborated by high-quality
```
registry studies). Nine recommendations are supported
```
```
by Level B randomized evidence (moderate evidence
```
```
from 1 or more RCTs) and 32 by Level B nonrandomized
```
evidence. The majority of recommendations are based
on Level C evidence, including those based on limited
```
data (67 recommendations) and expert opinion (125
```
```
recommendations). Accordingly, the strength of recom-
```
```
mendations is weaker than optimal; 66 Class 1 (strong)
```
```
recommendations, 84 Class 2a (moderate) recommen-
```
```
dations, and 58 Class 2b (weak) recommendations are
```
included in these guidelines. In addition, 21 recommen-
dations are designated Class 3: No Benefit and 6 recom-
mendations are Class 3: Harm. Clinical trials, thoughtfully
designed intervention studies with real-world applicabil-
ity, and well-controlled observational studies in special
circumstances science are needed.
Guideline Structure
These guidelines are organized into modular knowledge
chunks grouped into discrete modules of information
on specific topics or management issues. Each modular
knowledge chunk includes a table of recommendations
that uses standard AHA nomenclature of COR and LOE.
A brief introduction is provided for topics with multiple sets
of recommendations, and a synopsis may also be written
to put the recommendations into context with important
background information and overarching management or
treatment concepts. Recommendation-specific support-
ive text clarifies the rationale and key study data support-
ing the recommendations. When appropriate, figures, flow
diagrams, and additional tables are included.
Document Review and Approval
All guidelines were reviewed and approved for publica-
tion by the AHA Emergency Cardiovascular Care Sci-
ence Advisory Committee, the AHA Scientific Advisory
and Coordinating Committee, and the AHA Executive
Committee. These guidelines were also submitted for
blinded peer review to subject matter experts nominated
by the AHA. Before appointment, all peer reviewers were
required to disclose relationships with industry and any
other conflicts of interest, and all disclosures were re-
viewed by AHA journal staff. Comprehensive disclosure
information for peer reviewers is listed in the Reviewer
```
Disclosure Table (Appendix 2).
```
These recommendations supersede the last full set
of AHA special circumstances guidelines, published in
2020, and recommendations from the focused updates
on toxicology and drowning.1–3
To maintain consistency across the different chapters
of the guidelines, the LOE for some recommendations
```
that were previously assigned LOE B-NR (nonrandom-
```
```
ized) or C-LD (limited data) based on uncontrolled obser-
```
vational studies, case reports, and nonhuman studies
```
were modified to C-EO (expert opinion). Supporting data
```
are provided in the recommendation-specific supportive
text.

MAJOR CONCEPTS
Overview
Survival and recovery from cardiac arrest depend on a
complex system working together to achieve the best
outcomes. The main focus of treatment of adults and chil-
dren in cardiac arrest includes rapid recognition, prompt
provision of CPR, defibrillation of malignant shockable
rhythms, adequate ventilation, post–return of spontane-
```
ous circulation (ROSC) supportive care, and treatment of
```
underlying causes. This approach recognizes that cardiac
arrest is due to either primary cardiac causes, such as
myocardial infarction and electric disturbances, or with-
out a primary cardiac origin, such as respiratory failure
or toxic ingestion. In such cases, treatment for revers-
ible underlying causes is important for the rescuer to
consider. For any cardiac arrest, rescuers are instructed

to call for help, perform CPR with breaths, and apply an
```
automated external defibrillator (AED) to directly treat
```
```
ventricular fibrillation (VF) or ventricular tachycardia (VT),
```
if present. Although the majority of resuscitation success
is achieved by the provision of high-quality CPR and de-
fibrillation, other specific treatments for likely underlying
causes may be helpful in some cases.
These guidelines, focusing on the special circum-
stances as etiologies of cardiac arrest, provide and
evaluate specific treatment options meant to be admin-
istered in addition to, and alongside, traditional resus-
citation care. Unless otherwise specified, all patients
should receive standard airway management, support
of breathing, and treatment of hypotension, arrhythmias,
and cardiac arrest consistent with local protocols and the
resources available at the site of treatment.
ALTERNATIVE CPR TECHNIQUES
Introduction
In addition to defibrillation, several alternative and
pseudoelectrical therapies have been explored as pos-
sible treatment options during cardiac arrest. Precordial
```
thump is a single, sharp, high-velocity impact (or “punch”)
```
to the middle of the sternum delivered by the ulnar as-
pect of a tightly clenched fist. A precordial thump can
generate an electric impulse, theoretically interrupting
a life-threatening tachyarrhythmia or “kick-starting” the
heart in asystole. 1 However, if a precordial thump is ad-
ministered during the electrically vulnerable portion of
```
an organized rhythm (T wave), like an unsynchronized
```
shock or commotio cordis, there is a risk of deterioration
```
of cardiac rhythm. Percussion (fist) pacing is the delivery
```
of serial, rhythmic, relatively low-velocity impacts to the
sternum by the ulnar aspect of a closed fist. This is ad-
ministered to stimulate an electric impulse sufficient to
cause myocardial depolarization and electrically pace the
heart in cases of asystole or a life-threatening bradyar-
rhythmia. 1 Cough CPR involves a deep breath followed
immediately by a cough, repeated every few seconds,
to provide transient hemodynamic support at the onset
of a hemodynamically significant arrhythmia in a patient
who is both conscious and cooperative. Interposed ab-
dominal compression CPR is a 3-rescuer technique that
involves conventional chest compressions combined
with alternating abdominal compressions. The dedicat-
ed rescuer who provides manual abdominal compres-
sions will compress the abdomen midway between the
xiphoid and the umbilicus during the relaxation phase of
chest compression. Alternative techniques for perform-
ing interposed abdominal compression involve use of
compression devices. One such device consists of pres-
sure application handles, a compression plate, and a
display panel showing compression force, and a second
device uses a seesaw-like function, causing abdominal
decompression during sternal compression and vice ver-
sa. 2,3 These devices are not currently available in North
America and are therefore outside the scope of these
recommendations.
Recommendations for precordial thump, precordial
pacing, and interposed abdominal compression in adults
and children inform the management of adults and chil-
dren in cardiac arrest. Recommendations for cough CPR
inform the management of adults and children who have
life-threatening arrhythmias but are conscious and able
to follow commands.

Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. The use of a precordial thump during routine car-
diac arrest care in the out-of-hospital setting did
not improve survival to hospital discharge com-
pared with standard CPR in adults in 2 nonran-
domized studies. 4,5 Defibrillation, as a first-line
intervention, is significantly more likely to result
in ROSC.4 In adults, precordial thump resulted in
immediate ROSC in some cases of in-hospital
```
cardiac arrest (IHCA) and out-of-hospital cardiac
```
```
arrest (OHCA) but also led to rhythm degenera-
```
tion, such as from VT to VF or asystole. 4,6–9 The
majority of reports of successful use of precordial
thump are for ventricular arrhythmias in adults with
IHCA with success more likely in cases with VT
than VF. 7,9–15 There are also cases of a precordial
thump successfully causing ROSC in adults with
asystole. 5,6 There are reports of successful use of
a precordial thump for restoration of cardiac out-
put in adult cases of induced ventricular tachyar-
rhythmias in the inpatient cardiology setting, but
the majority of cases failed to respond.16–19 Across
studies, there is a lack of standardization in the
technique of precordial thump, the number of times
it was used, pharmacological therapy administered
before or after its delivery, and—in some cases—its
timing related to the onset of the arrhythmia.
2. There are no studies on the use of precordial thump
during cardiac arrest in children. Extrapolating from
data for adults, it can be stated that precordial
thump does not improve outcomes compared with
standard ALS in OHCA, and there are no compara-
tive studies for IHCA. There are case reports of

Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. Limited evidence from adult descriptive studies
demonstrates effective use of percussion pac-
ing during witnessed inpatient asystolic or life-
threatening bradycardic events with favorable
outcomes of survival to hospital discharge, ROSC,
or restoration of cardiac output.21–25
2. No controlled or comparative studies show that the
use of percussion pacing improves outcomes com-
pared with standard therapy in adults. It would not
be appropriate to prioritize percussion pacing over
other measures with proven efficacy.25
3. No controlled or comparative studies show that the
use of percussion pacing improves outcomes com-
pared with standard therapy in children. Two pedi-
atric cases show successful generation of a QRS
complex and pulse with percussion pacing. 25,26 It
would not be appropriate to prioritize percussion
pacing over other measures with proven efficacy.

Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. Some evidence suggests that cough CPR
increases aortic and left ventricular pressures. 27,28
Observational studies describe the use of cough
CPR in conscious adults at the witnessed onset of
```
several arrhythmias (VT, VF, high-degree atrioven-
```
tricular [AV] blocks, severe bradycardia, and asys-
```
tole) with successful termination and prevention
```
of loss of consciousness. 6,27–29 In 1 study of 115
adults with Morgagni-Adams-Stokes syndrome
and frequent fainting episodes during arrhythmias,
patients were trained in cough CPR. On follow-up,
66 patients applied cough CPR in a total of 365
events, 80% of which were reported as effective,
but these occurred in an unmonitored setting so
the cardiac rhythm at the time of symptoms is
unknown. 28 Importantly, while cough CPR may be
reasonable in specific circumstances, it may divert
time, effort, and attention from clinicians perform-
ing high-quality CPR or patients seeking medical
attention.
2. No controlled or comparative studies show that
use of cough CPR improves outcomes compared
with standard therapy in adult patients. The risks
```
are (1) that it delays effective treatment (early
```
call for help, early CPR and defibrillation if the
patient loses consciousness and stops breath-
```
ing normally) and (2) that members of the pub-
```
lic who confuse cardiac arrest with heart attack
delay seeking help when suffering chest pain or
other symptoms indicating a possible ischemic
cardiac event. An untrained adult is unlikely to be
able to reliably identify a cardiac arrest rhythm
in time to initiate coughing to maintain a cardiac
output. It would not be appropriate to prioritize
cough CPR over other measures with proven
efficacy.
3. There are no studies of cough CPR in children.
There is risk of delaying effective treatment, and
younger children are unlikely to understand or cor-
rectly perform the technique. It would not be appro-
priate to prioritize cough CPR over other measures
with proven efficacy.

1. Two early, relatively small, unblinded adult RCTs
of interposed abdominal compression CPR com-
pared with standard CPR for IHCA done at a single
institution during different time periods showed
improved ROSC, short-term survival, and survival to
hospital discharge.30,31 Two recent, relatively small,
unblinded adult RCTs of interposed abdominal
compression CPR in IHCA showed no difference
in ROSC. 32,33 Two RCTs of adult OHCA did not
show any increase in ROSC. 34,35 More evaluation
is needed to define the optimal clinical scenario for
this technique.

ANAPHYLAXIS
Recommendations for Adults and Children in Cardiac Arrest From
Anaphylaxis
COR LOE Recommendations
2a C-EO
1. It is reasonable to fluid resuscitate adults and
children in cardiac arrest from anaphylaxis with
isotonic IV fluids.
2a C-EO
2. It is reasonable to use extracorporeal CPR
```
(ECPR) for adults and children in cardiac arrest
```
from anaphylaxis refractory to pharmacological
interventions.
2b C-EO
3. It may be reasonable to administer glucagon to
adults and children who are in cardiac arrest
from anaphylaxis with suspected or confirmed
concurrent β-blocker use and who are refractory to
standard ALS or PALS medications.
2b C-EO
4. For adults and children in cardiac arrest from
rocuronium-induced anaphylaxis, the effectiveness
of sugammadex is uncertain.
2b C-EO
5. For adults and children in cardiac arrest from
anaphylaxis, the effectiveness of standard
```
anaphylaxis intramuscular (IM) epinephrine dose is
```
uncertain.
Synopsis
Anaphylaxis represents a severe multisystem immune mod-
ulated reaction to a substance that can occur across all age
groups. Common triggers include insects, foods, and medi-
cations, such as anesthetics, antibiotics, blood products, and
chemotherapeutics. Perioperative anaphylaxis can be chal-
lenging to diagnose and has resulted in delayed treatment.1
Anaphylaxis after neuromuscular blockade resulting in car-
```
diac arrest has been associated with high mortality (34.7%)
```
even when ALS guidelines are followed.2 Acute coronary
syndrome resulting from a rare allergic reaction, also known
as Kounis syndrome, with patient-specific complexities is
beyond the scope of this review.3
Immune activation can manifest systemically, most
commonly affecting the skin, gastrointestinal, pulmonary,
and cardiovascular systems. The rapidity of onset and
progression to airway occlusion with potential cardio-
vascular collapse make timely diagnosis and treatment
essential for positive outcomes.
Options for treatment of anaphylaxis in the peri-arrest
```
setting include epinephrine (IM or IV), antihistamines,
```
bronchodilators, corticosteroids, glucagon, and discon-
tinuation or removal of the trigger.
Our review did not identify any interventional studies
for cardiac arrest from anaphylaxis. All reviewed studies
were observational studies of anaphylaxis, which included
subgroups with cardiac arrest. These recommendations
inform the management of adults and children in cardiac
arrest from anaphylaxis.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. Intravascular volume depletion secondary to fluid
extravasation is a reversible cause of cardiac
arrest. The use of isotonic fluid resuscitation for
cardiac arrest from anaphylaxis is supported only
by case studies. In 1 adult case report, 73% of
administered fluid had been reported to extrava-
sate to the extravascular space via third spacing
and increased vascular permeability during ana-
phylaxis.4 In a non–cardiac arrest clinical trial of
adult patients with anaphylaxis, patients had more
rapid improvement in symptoms with IV fluids.5
There is no data specific to children.
2. Evidence for ECPR in the setting of anaphylaxis
is limited to case reports. In 1 case series of 6
```
patients (5 adults and 1 adolescent), only 1 of the 4
```
adults in cardiac arrest received ECPR.6 The patient
survived and had a favorable neurological outcome.
In a case series of 6 adults with cardiac arrest from
anaphylaxis following succinylcholine exposure,
only 1 received ECPR but died after 12 days.7
3. Indirect evidence from anaphylaxis-induced hypo-
tension in adult case reports supports the admin-
```
istration of glucagon (1–5 mg IV in adults, 20–30
```
```
mcg/kg IV push up to 1 mg in children) in the treat-
```
ment of refractory anaphylaxis in patients with con-
current β-blocker use or suspected exposure. 8–10
Administration should not preclude standard ALS
or PALS protocols. There is no data specific to
children.
4. In an adult observational study of severe anaphy-
laxis after exposure to neuromuscular blocking
agents, a history of cardiovascular disease other
than hypertension was identified as a risk factor
for death from cardiac arrest. 2 The survival from
```
cardiac arrest in this study was 156/199 (78%).
```
Case reports exist suggesting sugammadex as a
potential treatment for anaphylaxis associated with
rocuronium. However, a case series in adults did
not show improvement in outcomes of anaphylaxis
without cardiac arrest.11 A second study in adults
found decreased vasopressor requirements in 4 of
7 patients who received sugammadex. 1 There are
no data specific to children.
5. Extrapolation of findings from studies in adults and
children indicates that the bioavailability and time
```
to peak blood concentration for equal-dose (eg,
```
```
mg/kg) IM epinephrine is inferior to IV and intraos-
```
```
seous (IO) routes of administration. When com-
```
paring pharmacokinetics across different studies,
anaphylaxis dose IM epinephrine had lower and
delayed peak epinephrine concentrations as com-
pared to IV epinephrine in cardiac arrest. 12–16 There
is limited high-quality data directly comparing IV or
IO epinephrine with IM epinephrine, including no
data for cardiac arrest secondary to anaphylaxis.
In a before-and-after implementation study of an
```
early, first-dose IM epinephrine (5 mg) for 1405
```
adults with OHCA compared with usual care, IM

epinephrine was associated with improved survival
```
to hospital admission (adjusted odds ratio [aOR],
```
```
1.37; 95% CI, 1.06–1.77), hospital survival (aOR,
```

```
```
logic status at hospital discharge (aOR, 1.72; 95%
```
```
CI, 1.07–2.76).17 Notably, the dose of epinephrine
```
administered by the IM route was much higher
than standard ALS or PALS IV or IO dosing and
standard dosing for anaphylaxis management. 18 In
cardiac arrest from anaphylaxis, standard anaphy-
laxis IM epinephrine dose may be insufficient.

with life-threatening asthma refractory to standard
therapies may be considered.
Synopsis
Asthma can lead to cardiac arrest primarily from in-
creased lower airway obstruction leading to hypoxemia,
hypercarbia, respiratory acidosis, and increased intra-
thoracic pressure leading to decreased cardiac output.1
Care of the patient in the setting of an acute asthma
exacerbation includes bronchodilators, steroids, and
noninvasive ventilation and in cardiac arrest standard re-
suscitation.2 There are insufficient data to comment on
the use of magnesium or ketamine in patients with life-
threatening asthma.
These recommendations inform the management of
adults and children with life-threatening asthma exacer-
bation, including cardiac arrest.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. Tension pneumothorax is a rare life-threatening
complication of asthma and a potentially revers-
ible cause of cardiac arrest. Although tension
pneumothorax usually occurs in mechanically
ventilated patients, cases are also reported in
spontaneously breathing adults and children. 3–5

High peak airway pressures resulting from
positive-pressure ventilation can lead to pneu-
mothorax. While difficulty ventilating an adult
or child with asthma in extremis is more likely
due to hyperinflation and high intrathoracic
pressure, evaluation for tension pneumothorax
remains important.3–5
2. Multiple observational studies in adults and
children have demonstrated the use of ECLS in
the context of respiratory failure from asthma
refractory to standard care.6–13 Survival rates
in these studies are 83.5% to 100%. Most
patients in these studies were supported with
```
venovenous ECMO; however, patients with
```
hemodynamic instability in addition to persis-
tent hypoxia, hypercarbia, or barotrauma may
require VA-ECMO support.
3 and 4. Acute respiratory failure can precipitate car-
diac arrest in adults and children with asthma,
which is characterized by severe obstruction
leading to air trapping. Because of the limita-
tion in exhalation air flow, delivery of large tidal
volumes at a higher respiratory rate can lead
to progressive worsening of air trapping and a
decrease in effective ventilation. An approach
described in adult asthma patients using
lower tidal volumes, lower respiratory rate, and
increased expiratory time may minimize the risk
of intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure and
barotrauma.14,15 This approach may be extrapo-
lated to children with life-threatening asthma.
5. Several observational studies in adults and
children have demonstrated the use of volatile
anesthetics in the context of respiratory fail-
ure from asthma refractory to bronchodilators,
steroids, intubation, mechanical ventilation,
sedation, and neuromuscular blockade. 7,10,16–20
Survival ranged from 87% to 100% in these
studies. Two of these studies compared ECLS
versus volatile anesthetics. 7,10 These studies
did not show a significant difference in mortal-
ity but had mixed results in other clinical end-
points, such as length of stay, complication rate,
and occurrence of patient procedures.
6. Adults and children with severe asthma have
limited ability to exhale and have a phenome-
non known as breath stacking. This, in turn, can
lead to an increase in intrathoracic pressure,
decrease in venous return, decrease in blood
pressure, decrease in coronary perfusion pres-
sure, and, ultimately, cardiac arrest. Adults and
children manifest with difficulty ventilating, high
airway pressure during ventilation, or a sudden
decrease in blood pressure. Brief disconnec-
tion from the ventilator or a pause in bag-mask
ventilation and compression of the thorax to
aid exhalation may relieve hyperinflation. This
practice is informed by several case series with
mixed conclusions. In 3 case series, adults and
children received active exhalation maneuvers
via external compression to relieve air trap-
ping with improvement in clinical status.21–23
However, 1 case series of 4 adults showed no
improvement with external compression during
exhalation.24

CARDIAC INTERVENTION LABORATORY
Recommendations for Adults in Cardiac Arrest in the Cardiac
Intervention Laboratory
COR LOE Recommendations
2a C-LD
1. It is reasonable to use mechanical CPR devices to
provide chest compressions to adults in cardiac
arrest in the cardiac intervention laboratory.
2a C-LD
2. It is reasonable to use ECLS in adults in cardiac
arrest in the cardiac intervention laboratory when
initial therapy is failing.
2b C-LD
3. It may be reasonable to use intracoronary
epinephrine for adults in cardiac arrest in
the cardiac intervention laboratory during
```
percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).
```
Synopsis
Diagnostic and therapeutic cardiovascular procedures—
such as coronary angiography, PCI, transcatheter valvu-
lar intervention, and catheter ablation—are performed in
the cardiac intervention laboratory. Potential procedural
risks include coronary or myocardial injury associated
with coronary ischemia, pericardial effusion or cardiac
tamponade, severe valvular dysfunction, or malignant ar-
rhythmia, all of which can lead to cardiac arrest. Severe
cardiovascular comorbidities are common in these pa-
tients, increasing the risk of cardiovascular complications.
Cardiac arrest during PCI has better survival than in
other settings, including in-hospital units, likely because
of vigilant monitoring, immediate defibrillator availability,
established intravascular access, and rapid intervention
to treat the cause of cardiac arrest.1–10
Many patients with cardiac arrest in the cardiac inter-
vention laboratory will respond to standard advanced
```
cardiovascular life support (ACLS). In some cases,
```
high-quality CPR may interfere with corrective interven-
```
tions (eg, pericardiocentesis) or vice versa.
```
These recommendations inform the management of
adults in cardiac arrest and do not pertain to adults who
are in cardiogenic shock without cardiac arrest or those
who are in cardiac arrest prior to arrival in the cardiac
interventional laboratory.
These recommendations are specific to adults
because studies specific to children were not included in
the literature review.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. Observational studies in adults have demonstrated
the feasibility of using mechanical CPR devices
for administering chest compressions to adults
in cardiac arrest in the cardiac intervention labo-
ratory.11–17 This allows performance of potentially
lifesaving interventions, such as PCI or placement
of mechanical circulatory support, while avoiding
gaps in the performance of CPR. Most studies
utilized a mechanical piston device, and 1 used
a load-distributing band.11,13–17 Two studies on
mechanical CPR in adults in cardiac arrest that
specifically occurred in the cardiac intervention
laboratory showed 25% survival with good neu-
rological outcome, and 1 showed improved out-
comes compared with manual CPR.16,17 In another
comparative study including adults in cardiac arrest
prior to arrival in the cardiac intervention labora-
tory, patients receiving mechanical chest compres-
sions were more likely to achieve ROSC than those
receiving manual chest compressions.15 However,
both comparative studies were nonrandomized,
had small sample sizes, and compared against
a historical cohort, which coincided with major
changes in resuscitation guidelines.15,16
2. There are no comparative studies on the use of
ECLS versus standard therapy for adults in cardiac
arrest in the cardiac intervention laboratory. The rec-
ommendation for ECLS is informed by prospective
observational studies.18–24 However, many studies
include adults receiving ECLS for cardiac arrest that
occurred prior to the cardiac intervention laboratory
or ECLS use for cardiogenic shock without cardiac
arrest. The Extracorporeal Life Support Organization
```
(ELSO) Registry found survival to hospital discharge
```
was 39% in patients receiving ECLS for cardiac
arrest in the cardiac intervention laboratory, with a
lower risk-adjusted odds of mortality in this popu-
lation than in those with cardiac arrest receiving
ECLS in an ICU or in a hospital bed.21 Notably, some
patients in this study received mechanical circula-
tory support prior to cardiac arrest, which may con-
found outcome data. The largest study of adults who
specifically had initial cardiac arrest in the cardiac

intervention laboratory showed a 30-day survival
of 44%.23 There are reports of successful use of
standby ECMO in adults undergoing high-risk PCIs
and transcatheter aortic valve replacements in the
cardiac intervention laboratory.25,26 Standby ECMO
```
(placement of small-bore vascular sheaths and
```
preprimed ECMO circuits with appropriately sized
```
cannulas ready prior to cannulation) was associated
```
with lower low-flow time, lower rate of acute kidney
injury, and improved 30-day survival compared with
```
extemporaneous ECMO (no cannulation or prepa-
```
```
ration of an ECMO circuit prior to cardiac arrest) in
```
high-risk PCI.25
3. Two prospective cohort studies compared epi-
```
nephrine (1 mg every 3–5 minutes) via intracoro-
```
```
nary versus IV (peripheral or central) administration
```
in 320 adults who developed cardiac arrest in the
cardiac intervention laboratory.27,28 Both showed
improved outcomes, such as ROSC and survival
with favorable neurological outcome, with intracor-
onary epinephrine. However, both studies were lim-
ited by potential confounding because the route of
epinephrine administration was at the physician’s
discretion and due to some inherent differences
between groups.

CARDIAC SURGERY
Introduction
Cardiac arrest after cardiac surgery occurs in patients
relatively infrequently, although these patients typically
have better outcomes than those with other etiologies
of cardiac arrest in different settings. 1 Common causes
```
of cardiac arrest in this setting include VF (typically
```
```
secondary to ischemia or pacemaker malfunction), car-
```
diac tamponade, and severe hypovolemia from bleeding.
Unique to this setting is the highly monitored nature of
the postoperative ICU as well as the potential for car-
diac trauma with chest compressions given the recent
surgical suture lines. This population also often has the
potential for temporary pacing through epicardial wires
attached at the time of the operation as well as the
relative ease of performing emergent resternotomy and
internal cardiac massage, which provides improved out-
put compared with external chest compressions. 2 The
```
2017 Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) consensus
```
statement on this topic, including recommendations
for children, minimally invasive heart surgeries, LVADs,
transplant patients, and sternotomy and nonsternoto-
my operations, in addition to evidence review from the
writing group informs these guidelines. Further, these
societal guidelines are focused on the initial hospitaliza-
tion from the operation itself, particularly during the ICU
course. 1 Refer to other relevant sections of the 2025
AHA guidelines for recommendations related to cardiac
arrest during or immediately after cardiac catheteriza-
```
tion (refer to Cardiac Intervention Laboratory) or cardiac
```
arrest in patients with LVADs who are remote from the
```
immediate postoperative period (refer to Left Ventricular
```
```
Assist Devices).
```
These recommendations inform the management of
adults and children in cardiac arrest after cardiac surgery.
Recommendations for Adults in Cardiac Arrest After Cardiac Surgery
COR LOE Recommendations
1 B-NR
1. For adults in cardiac arrest after cardiac surgery,
external chest compressions should be performed
if emergency resternotomy is not immediately
available.
1 C-EO
2. For adults in VF cardiac arrest after cardiac
surgery, if a trained professional witnesses the
cardiac arrest, immediate 3-stacked defibrillation
should be performed, and CPR should be initiated
if defibrillation is not successful within 1 minute.
1 C-EO
3. For adults in asystole or a bradycardic arrest after
cardiac surgery, if a trained professional witnesses
the arrest and temporary pacing wires are already
in place, immediate pacing is recommended and
CPR should be initiated within 1 minute if pacing
is unsuccessful.
2a B-NR
4. For adults in cardiac arrest early after cardiac
surgery, it is reasonable to perform rapid
resternotomy in an appropriately staffed and
equipped ICU.
2a B-NR
5. Internal cardiac massage can be useful in adults
after cardiac surgery if cardiac arrest develops
when the chest or abdomen is open or in the early
postoperative period after cardiothoracic surgery
when the chest can be reopened rapidly.
2a C-EO
6. For adults in cardiac arrest after cardiac surgery
who are refractory to standard resuscitation,
ECLS can be effective.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. Chest compressions following cardiac surgery have
the potential for cardiac trauma as demonstrated in
adult case reports as well as cardiac trauma in oth-
ers who have not had cardiac surgery. 3,4 However,
adult observational studies have not reported such
trauma. 5,6 External chest compressions remain
the primary means of providing perfusion while
the chest is closed. In these cases, the benefit of
perfusion using external chest compressions out-
weighs the risk of potential cardiac trauma.
2. VF is a common presenting rhythm in cases of car-
diac arrest after cardiac surgery often secondary to
ischemia or pacemaker malfunction. Immediate defi-
brillation presents distinct advantages in these adult
patients, whereas the potential morbidity associated
with external chest compressions or resternotomy
may impact recovery.7 Limited adult data are avail-
able from defibrillator threshold testing with backup
transthoracic defibrillation using variable waveforms
and energy doses.8–10 First-shock success over
90% was observed in most of these studies, though
pooled results from 15 studies found a defibrilla-
tion success rate of 78% for the first shock, 35%
for the second, and 14% for the third.11 The STS
Task Force on Resuscitation After Cardiac Surgery
and the European Association for Cardio-thoracic
Surgery recommend 3-stacked defibrillations within
1 minute, before initiation of CPR or resternotomy.1,7
This departure from standard ACLS is likely war-
ranted in the post–cardiac surgery setting because

of the highly monitored setting and unique risks of
compressions and resternotomy.
3. Immediate pacing of adults in asystole or a bra-
dycardic arrest after cardiac surgery is supported
by surgical societies. 1,7 Available hemodynamic
monitoring modalities in conjunction with manual
pulse detection provide an opportunity to confirm
myocardial capture and adequate cardiac function.
When pacing attempts are not successful within 1
minute, standard ACLS including CPR is indicated.
4. No RCTs of resternotomy have been published.
Improved outcomes have been observed with
rapid resternotomy protocols when performed by
experienced health care professionals in an appro-
priately equipped ICU. 5,6,12–18 Other observational
studies show no benefit of resternotomy compared
with standard ACLS therapy.19–23 The STS recom-
mends that resternotomy be a standard part of the
resuscitation protocols for at least 10 days after
surgery.1 Resternotomy performed outside of the
ICU results in poor outcomes.16,21
5. A systematic review of external cardiac compres-
sions compared with internal cardiac massage that
included animal studies as well as 9 human stud-
ies consistently demonstrated improved cardiac
index and coronary perfusion pressure with inter-
nal massage.1,2,12,21,24–29 The authors of the sys-
tematic review concluded that prompt conversion
from external chest compressions to internal car-
diac massage improves opportunities for ROSC.2
The STS expert consensus statement and the
```
European Resuscitation Council (ERC) guidelines
```
recommend converting to internal cardiac mas-
sage unless brief resuscitation with defibrillation,
pacing, or medication is successful.2,7
6. Many case series in adults, collectively inclusive
of over 4000 patients, have reported rescue with
```
ECLS (eg, ECMO, ventricular assist device, cardio-
```
```
pulmonary bypass [CPB]) in the setting of refrac-
```
tory cardiac arrest or persistent cardiogenic shock
after cardiac surgery with a survival range of 36%
to 78%. 30–34 Cannulation for cardiogenic shock and
cardiac arrest postcardiotomy has been demon-
strated to be feasible, although with a low survival
```
rate (11%) in adults. 35

Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. Chest compressions following cardiac surgery
have the potential for cardiac trauma as demon-
strated in adult case reports as well as cardiac
trauma in others who have not had cardiac sur-
gery.3,4,36 However, adult observational studies have
not reported such trauma and external chest com-
pressions remain the primary means of providing
perfusion while the chest is closed. 5,6 No evidence
was identified specific to the pediatric population.
While there is no specific pediatric data, extrapolat-
ing from adult literature to children in cardiac arrest
following cardiac surgery, the benefit of perfusion
using external chest compressions outweighs the
risk of potential cardiac trauma.
2. No RCTs of resternotomy have been published.
Outcomes for resternotomy in the pediatric
population are extrapolated from mixed positive
and neutral studies in adults with rapid rester-
notomy protocols in an appropriately equipped
ICU. 5,6,12–20,22,23,37 One observational study including
adults and children showed proportionally greater
survival in children with resternotomy and open
chest cardiac compression.21 The STS recom-
mends that resternotomy be a standard part of the
resuscitation protocols for at least 10 days after
surgery. 1 Resternotomy performed outside of the
ICU results in poor outcomes.16,21
3. One study compared children receiving external
chest compressions and those receiving ECPR for
cardiac arrest post–cardiac surgery.38 Those who
received ECPR had an odds ratio for survival of
2.2. Additionally, many case series in children have
```
reported rescue with ECLS (eg, ECMO, ventricu-

DROWNING
Introduction
Drowning is the third leading cause of death from unin-
tentional injury worldwide, accounting for 7% of all injury-
related deaths. 1 Physical trauma, such as head injuries,
```
spinal injuries, or fractures from accidents (eg, diving and
```
```
boating accidents), can impair a person’s ability to re-
```
main conscious, swim, or stay afloat, increasing the risk
of drowning. Drowning generally progresses from initial
respiratory arrest due to submersion-related hypoxia to
```
cardiac arrest; thus, it can be challenging to distinguish
```
respiratory arrest from cardiac arrest because pulses are
difficult to accurately palpate within the recommended
10-second window. Therefore, resuscitation from cardiac
arrest attributable to this specific circumstance must fo-
cus on restoring breathing as much as it does circulation.2
These guidelines are designed for health care pro-
fessionals, trained rescuers, and untrained lay rescuers
resuscitating adults and children who have drowned. We
have defined trained rescuer as an individual with appro-
priate training to perform the task discussed in a given
recommendation. This is independent of the individual’s
occupation or ethical duty to respond. Lifeguards, swim-
ming instructors, emergency medical technicians, para-
medics, police, firefighters, other volunteers, and off-duty
health care professionals, if appropriately trained for
the task mentioned in the recommendation, would be
considered trained rescuers and would be expected
to respond in the recommended manner. 3 The Drown-
```
ing Chain of Survival (Figure 1) highlights a series of
```
interventions that reduce drowning-associated mortality
when put into action by trained rescuers or untrained lay
rescuers. 2,4

Synopsis
Whenever an unresponsive person is found in the water,
the rescuer is confronted with a difficult choice of wheth-
er to initiate breaths immediately or once the drowned
person has been removed from the water. The drowning
process involves initial hypoxia that may progress to re-
spiratory arrest followed by cardiac arrest if not promptly
addressed.5–12
This recommendation informs the management of
adults and children who are unresponsive after drowning
and not necessarily confirmed in cardiac arrest.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. One retrospective observational study of in-water
resuscitation of nonbreathing drowned adults and
children rescued by lifeguards found higher odds
of survival to hospital discharge and hospital sur-
vival with favorable neurological outcome compared
with similar individuals who did not receive in-water
resuscitation.12 Rescuers must consider personal
safety, availability of equipment, and distance to
shore when determining the appropriateness of
performing in-water breaths. When respiratory
arrest is addressed by breaths that interrupt the
```
drowning process, the death rate is lower (44%)
```
than in those cases that progress to cardiac arrest
```
and receive CPR (93%). 6,7,9–12

Oxygen Administration Following Drowning
Recommendation for Oxygen Administration in Adults and Children in
Cardiac Arrest Following Drowning
COR LOE Recommendation
1 C-EO
1. Trained rescuers should provide supplemental
oxygen if available to adults and children with
cardiac arrest following drowning.
Synopsis
Hypoxia is the major sequela of drowning and when se-
vere and prolonged can lead to cardiac arrest. Even with
effective CPR, cardiac output, cerebral oxygenation, and
blood flow range from 12% to 42% of prearrest values.1–3
Additionally, there is decreased diffusion capacity of the
lungs from aspiration. A full discussion of the pathophysi-
ology of drowning is beyond the scope of this guideline.4
Adult BLS and pediatric BLS guidelines support the use
of maximal available oxygen concentration during CPR
```
(refer to “Part 6: Pediatric BLS” guidelines and “Part 7:
```
```
Adult BLS” guidelines). Oxygen administration has regu-
```
latory and legal restrictions in several countries and re-
quires the provision, use, and maintenance of equipment
as well as an understanding of the mechanisms and risks
of oxygen administration and storage. Use of oxygen may
be limited in low- and middle-income countries. These
recommendations inform the management of adults and
children in cardiac arrest following drowning.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. No study directly addresses the use, timing, or con-
centration of oxygen delivery to drowned adults and
children. The use of supplementary oxygen during
and after CPR is accepted practice for trained res-
cuers providing resuscitation from drowning due
to the hypoxic nature of the arrest.5,6 Hypoxemia
is associated with decreased survival to hospi-
tal admission, and rapid reversal of hypoxemia
through prompt bystander CPR is associated with
improved survival to hospital admission and neu-
rologically favorable survival from drowning. 7–15
We do not make a recommendation about the
use of pulse oximetry monitoring during drowning
because of uncertainty regarding the effectiveness

2a C-EO
4. It is reasonable to provide rescuers with a
competency-based training program with regular
retraining and maintenance of equipment.
Synopsis
Adequate ventilation is a priority during resuscitation in
cardiac arrest following drowning.1,2 This can be achieved
with the use of mouth-to-mouth breathing, pocket masks,
```
or other equipment (bag-mask device, supraglottic air-
```
```
way, or endotracheal intubation) according to the res-
```
cuer’s training and availability of ventilatory equipment. In
30:2 CPR following OHCA, lung inflation with bag-mask
ventilation is infrequent but is associated with improved
ROSC, survival to discharge, and survival with favorable
neurological outcomes. 3 In OHCA in general, current
guidelines support the use of bag-mask ventilation or
```
an advanced airway (supraglottic airway or endotracheal
```
```
tube), depending on the situation and the skill set of the
```
```
rescuer (refer to “Part 8: PALS” and “Part 9: ALS” in these
```
```
guidelines).3 Three RCTs comparing different airway
```
strategies in adult OHCA yielded similar results when the
```
rescuers were adept at advanced airway techniques (eg,
```
```
endotracheal intubation, supraglottic airway) but inferior
```
outcomes when they were not. 4–6 These studies highlight
the critical importance of effective ventilation by ensur-
ing secondary measures, such as monitoring chest rise
and fall.
These recommendations inform the management of
adults and children who are either in respiratory arrest
without cardiac arrest or who are in cardiac arrest follow-
ing drowning.

Cao et al Special Circumstances: 2025 AHA Guidelines for CPR and ECC
No human drowning studies have directly
compared the different methods of delivering
breaths.1,2 Manikin studies enrolling lifeguards
showed that mouth-to-mouth ventilation
resulted in fewer chest compression interrup-
tions and more effective ventilation and tidal
volume delivery than the use of a pocket mask,
bag-mask device, or face shield.11,12
2 and 3. Providing ventilations with equipment has not
been compared with no equipment during
resuscitation following drowning. 1,2 In 2 large
observational studies of adults with cardiac
arrest from drowning, there was no difference
in survival with good neurological outcome
between adults who had endotracheal intu-
bation and those with supraglottic airway or
bag-mask ventilation.13,14 In children with car-
diac arrest from drowning, endotracheal intu-
bation was associated with worse neurologic
outcomes. 15,16
4. CPR education research demonstrates that
providing effective breaths is a difficult skill to
master. Training is most effective when it incor-
porates a hands-on aspect and is repeated to
build retention.17–19

Cao et al Special Circumstances: 2025 AHA Guidelines for CPR and ECC
Synopsis
While these recommendations adhere to standard BLS
principles, adults and children removed from the water
without normal breathing or consciousness have impor-
tant physiologic considerations that may modify standard
algorithms. Cardiac arrest following drowning is most
often due to a hypoxic mechanism, whereas sudden car-
diac arrest, particularly in adults, is more likely to occur
with fully oxygenated blood. An emphasis on breaths is
highlighted in these recommendations.
These recommendations inform the management of
adults and children in cardiac arrest following drowning.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. Multiple large observational studies of adults
and children in cardiac arrest following drown-
ing show improved outcomes when CPR
included breaths.1–4
2 and 3. One study including primarily elderly patients
in hot tubs found no difference in outcomes
```
between conventional (eg, CPR with breaths)
```
and compression-only CPR. However, the
demographics of the individuals who drowned
in this study differed from those in most other
drowning studies. 5,6 Most cardiac arrests from
drowning are hypoxic in nature, and breaths
are important. However, the etiology of the
arrest may be unknown and some individu-
als in cardiac arrest from drowning will have a
primary cardiac etiology where compression-
only CPR is reasonable. No pediatric data on
compression-only CPR following drowning
were identified, thus, the pediatric recommen-
dation is extrapolated from the adult data.
4. There is no direct evidence evaluating the
sequence of resuscitation in cardiac arrest
```
following drowning in adults or children (eg,
```
airway-breathing-circulation versus circulation-
```
airway-breathing). One small observational
```
study found improved survival and neurologi-
cal outcome among nonbreathing adults and
children who may have had cardiac arrest
following drowning and received immediate
in-water breaths compared with delayed on-
land resuscitation.7 A manikin study that was
not specific to drowning found that the time
```
to completion of first CPR cycle (30 compres-
```
```
sions and 2 breaths) was 15 seconds shorter in
```
a compression-first strategy compared with an
airway and breathing–first strategy. 8 Initiating
CPR with airway, breathing, and chest com-
pressions by trained rescuers may be appropri-
ate as long as the initiation of breaths does not
```
delay compressions (eg, waiting for ventilation
```
```
equipment).

AED First Versus CPR First in Cardiac Arrest
Following Drowning
Recommendations for the Use of AED in Adults and Children in
Cardiac Arrest Following Drowning
COR LOE Recommendations
1 B-NR
1. For adults and children in cardiac arrest following
drowning, CPR with breaths should be started
before AED or defibrillator application.
2a B-NR 2. AED use is reasonable for adults and children incardiac arrest following drowning.
Synopsis
Cardiac arrest following drowning is most commonly
```
from a hypoxic drowning process; however, it less com-
```
monly may be from a primary cardiac event. 1 Initial shock-
```
able rhythms constitute a minority (2%–12%) of cardiac
```
arrests following drowning but are associated with higher
odds of survival. 2–8 Shockable rhythms following drown-
ing may be less common because of longer durations of
submersion or longer response times. The low incidence
of shockable rhythm supports the emphasis placed on
high-quality CPR with breaths elsewhere in this docu-
ment.2,4,6 Individuals may also present with shockable
cardiac arrest due to nondrowning causes in an aquatic
setting. AEDs are feasible and safe to use in cardiac ar-
rest following drowning.9,10 A trend toward more frequent
application of AEDs in cardiac arrest following drowning
has been demonstrated. 11

These recommendations inform the management of
adults and children in cardiac arrest following drowning.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. Observational studies in adults and children of
OHCA, and specifically cardiac arrest following
drowning, show improved survival to hospital dis-
charge or 30 days when CPR including breaths were
initiated promptly.8,12–14 AED application may present
delays to CPR. In a study of 919 adult and children
with cardiac arrest from drowning, where only 7.4%
had an initial shockable rhythm, an AED was applied
before emergency medical services arrival in 32.4%
and was associated with a decreased likelihood
of favorable neurological outcome in the adjusted
```
analyses (aOR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.23–0.77; P<0.005),
```
which may have been due to a delay in the initiation
of high-quality CPR with breaths and compressions.8
2. It is difficult to quantify the benefit of AED use in
cardiac arrest following drowning given that shock-
able rhythms occur less commonly in the drown-
ing process. When shockable rhythms are present,
AED application is practical and a shockable rhythm
confers a survival benefit in studies of adults and
children with cardiac arrest after drowning.4,6,8–11,15

Public Access Defibrillation Programs for
Drowning
Recommendation for Public Access Defibrillation Programs for
Drowning
COR LOE Recommendation
2a C-EO
1. Implementation of public access defibrillation
programs is reasonable in areas where there is
a high risk of cardiac arrest, including aquatic
environments.
Synopsis
Cardiac arrest can occur in high-use public areas, such as
airports, parks, beaches, pools, and other areas with high
population density, with frequent utilization, where other
forms of exercise are performed, or with long distances or
response time to the nearest AED. Early defibrillation is as-
```
sociated with increased odds of survival; therefore, ensur-
```
ing public access to defibrillators is important. Public access
```
defibrillation (PAD) programs have been associated with
```
improved outcomes for OHCA.1,2 Although initial shock-
```
able rhythms from drowning are uncommon (occurring in
```
```
2%–12% of cases of cardiac arrest following drowning),
```
for those who do have an initial shockable rhythm, early
defibrillation can be lifesaving.3–6 PAD programs have been
demonstrated to be cost-effective.7 Targeted AED place-
ment compared with nationwide deployment has been
```
demonstrated to have incremental cost-effectiveness;
```
however, cost-effectiveness data for AED placement in
aquatic environments are lacking. This recommendation
applies only to the programmatic placement of AEDs in
```
aquatic environments (eg, through public policies), not to
```
their specific use in resuscitation following drowning.8

ELECTROCUTION
Recommendation for Adults and Children in Cardiac Arrest From
Electrocution
COR LOE Recommendation
1 C-EO
1. Adults and children in cardiac arrest due
to electrical injury should receive standard
resuscitation.
Synopsis
Electricity causes various injuries depending on the
```
voltage, duration of contact, type of current (alternat-
```
```
ing or direct), and pathway of current traveling through
```
the body. 1 Depending on the type of exposure, patients
may experience significant burns, traumatic injuries,
arrhythmias, cardiac injury, or cardiac arrest. Multiple
arrhythmias are described following electrical injuries,
including atrial fibrillation, VF, VT, and pulseless elec-
```
trical activity (PEA). 1,2 The care of patients with burns,
```
cardiac dysfunction, myocardial infarction, and traumat-
ic injuries from electricity is beyond the scope of this
recommendation.
These recommendations inform the management of
adults and children in cardiac arrest from electrocution.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. The mainstay of care of adults and children in
cardiac arrest following electrical injury includes
adherence to standard BLS and pediatric BLS
as well as ALS and PALS guidelines, including
rapid defibrillation and high-quality CPR as well
as scene safety for responders. No clinical trials
or controlled observational studies are available
to inform the care of adults and children in car-
diac arrest or peri-arrest following electrical injury.
Numerous adult and pediatric case reports and
case series describe patients with cardiac arrest,
including with VF, VT, and PEA, who responded to
standard resuscitation. 2,3 There are adult and pedi-
atric case reports of patients surviving with good
```
neurologic outcome following prolonged CPR (up
```
```
to 70 minutes) for cardiac arrest following electri-
```
cal injury. 4–6

GAS EMBOLISM
Recommendations for Adults and Children With Life-Threatening Gas
Embolism
COR LOE Recommendations
1 C-EO 1. Adults and children with life-threatening gasembolism should receive 100% oxygen.
2a B-NR 2. It is reasonable to use hyperbaric oxygen for adultswith life-threatening gas embolism.
2a C-EO 3. It is reasonable to use hyperbaric oxygen forchildren with life-threatening gas embolism.
2a C-EO
4. It is reasonable to position adults and children
with life-threatening gas embolism supine or in the
recovery position, on a level surface.
2b C-EO
5. For adults, it may be reasonable to attempt
aspiration of life-threatening right ventricular gas
embolism, using a needle or a catheter, when the
location of gas is known and accessible.
Synopsis
Arterial or venous gas embolism can occur due to medi-
cal intervention, trauma, barotrauma, decompression
sickness, and other causes. Bubble composition may
comprise air, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide.1
Gas in the arterial system rises to the least dependent
vascular bed. Cerebral arterial gas embolism can occlude
arteries, causing ischemic stroke. Coronary artery gas
embolism can cause myocardial infarction, cardiogenic
shock, or cardiac arrest. Venous gas can occlude right
ventricular or pulmonary arterial blood flow, causing
shock and cardiac arrest. Venous gas can reach the arte-
```
rial system (“paradoxical gas embolism”) through a patent
```
foramen ovale or transpulmonary passage. In addition to
obstructing blood vessels, gas embolism causes vascular
injury, vasospasm, and thromboinflammation.2
Whether the same treatment is ideal for arterial and
venous gas embolism, for all types of gas, or for all mech-
anisms of embolism production is unclear. No clinical tri-
als have been conducted, and animal studies may not
fully translate to humans. Treatment is informed by many
case reports, case series, and observational comparison
studies, almost all involving adults.
Nothing about the presence of gas embolism pro-
vides a contraindication to standard resuscitation, and
some patients recover with standard resuscitation alone. 3
The use of lidocaine or other medications for neuro-
protection in patients with stroke due to cerebral arterial
gas embolism is outside the scope of these guidelines.
These recommendations inform the management of
adults and children with life-threatening gas embolism,
including cardiac arrest.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. In addition to treating tissue hypoxia, supple-
mental oxygen increases the diffusion of nitro-
gen out of gas bubbles while also improving
oxygenation of adjacent ischemic tissues. 4 This
recommendation is supported by adult and
pediatric case reports.5
2 and 3. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy for gas embolism is
supported by 2 adult nonrandomized observa-
tional studies, adult case series, limited pediatric
case series, and animal studies.3,6–10 Hyperbaric
oxygen therapy compresses gas bubbles,
increases diffusion of nitrogen and other gases
from the bubble, oxygenates adjacent tissue,
and reduces inflammatory cascades.11 It is not
feasible to provide hyperbaric oxygen therapy
for patients in cardiac arrest in most settings.
4. The Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society
recommends that people with gas embolism
who have normal mental status be positioned
supine and that those with altered mental status
be positioned in the recovery position, which is
consistent with standard first aid principles.12–14
The US Navy Diving Manual also recommends
level positioning during transport to definitive
therapy.15 Neither organization currently recom-
```
mends head-down (Trendelenburg) positioning.
```
These recommendations are not universally
accepted, with some experts recommending
```
the Durant position (left lateral decubitus, head
```
```
down), at least for venous gas embolism.16,17
```
Studies of whether head-down positioning
results in redistribution of intravascular bubbles
are contradictory, and limited animal data sug-
gest that head-down positioning may worsen
cerebral edema.18–21 Effective CPR cannot be
```
performed in the recovery (lateral decubitus)
```
position, and standard resuscitation practice
calls for compressions to be administered with
```
the patient positioned supine (refer to “Part 7:
```
```
Adult BLS” guidelines). Treatment recommen-
```
dations from the Undersea and Hyperbaric
```
Medical Society do not comment on age; sup-
```
porting data are largely based on animal studies
and adult case reports, and, thus, recommenda-
tions for children are extrapolated.
5. Aspiration of gas from the right ventricle using
either a needle or catheter is described in adult
case reports and animal studies.22–24 The suc-
cess rate of this procedure and whether it can
safely be performed without ultrasound or fluo-
roscopic guidance is unknown.25 No data were
identified for gas aspiration in children.

HIGH-CONSEQUENCE RESPIRATORY
PATHOGENS
Recommendations to Reduce the Risk of Transmission of High-
Consequence Respiratory Pathogens During Treatment of Cardiac
Arrest in Adults and Children
COR LOE Recommendation
1 C-LD
1. Chest compressions, bag-mask ventilation,
defibrillation, suctioning, and endotracheal
intubation should be considered aerosol-
```
generating procedures (AGPs) for adults and
```
children with confirmed or suspected high-
consequence respiratory pathogens.
1 C-LD
2. Resuscitation team members should wear PPE
when in the resuscitation environment, including
```
respiratory protection (N-95 respirator or purifying
```
```
air-powered respirator), eye protection, gloves,
```
and protection against contamination of clothing.
1 C-LD
3. When performing endotracheal intubation of adults
with confirmed or suspected high-consequence
respiratory pathogens, video laryngoscopy is
preferred compared with direct laryngoscopy.
1 C-EO
4. When performing endotracheal intubation of
children with confirmed or suspected high-
consequence respiratory pathogens, video
laryngoscopy is preferred compared with direct
laryngoscopy.
1 C-EO
5. Whenever possible, all ventilation devices
applied to adults and children with confirmed
or suspected high-consequence respiratory
pathogens should include a high-efficiency
particle air filter to remove fugitive aerosols from
ventilation device outflow.
1 C-EO
6. Resuscitation team leaders should minimize
the number of people present in the room
during resuscitation, consistent with effective
resuscitation.
2a C-LD
7. It is reasonable to dedicate a resuscitation team
member to monitor and coach team members to
adhere to PPE procedures.
2a C-LD
8. It is reasonable to use mechanical CPR devices
to provide compressions in adults with confirmed
or suspected high-consequence respiratory
pathogens, with the goal of maintaining consistent
CPR quality while reducing the number of at-risk
resuscitation team members.
2a C-EO
9. It is reasonable to perform endotracheal intubation,
rather than bag-mask ventilation, for adults with
confirmed or suspected high-consequence
respiratory pathogen to reduce the number of
respirable particles generated during resuscitation.
2b C-EO
10. It may be reasonable to perform endotracheal
intubation, rather than bag-mask ventilation,
for children with confirmed or suspected high-
consequence respiratory pathogens to reduce

Synopsis
Worldwide pandemics caused by high-consequence
pathogens, as termed by the Centers for Disease Control,
```
are common. Recent examples include SARS (2002–
```
```
2003), influenza H1N1 (2009–2010), Middle East
```
```
respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV, approxi-
```
```
mately 2012–2015), and SARS-CoV-2 (or COVID-19,
```
```
approximately 2019–2022). These infections are spread
```
by direct contact with a combination of respiratory se-
cretions, droplets, and aerosols. 1 Effective vaccines and
treatment may not be available during the early stages of
a pandemic, putting resuscitation team members at risk.
The AHA released interim guidance for BLS and ALS
modifications for patients with suspected or confirmed
SARS-CoV-2 in 2020 and 2022 to provide effective re-
suscitation while minimizing risk. 2,3 The recommendations
in this section supersede that guidance, broaden the
recommendations to encompass all high-consequence
pathogens, and acknowledge the limitations of not know-
ing the transmissibility of future pathogens.
Most studies in this area relate to IHCA, with less litera-
ture related to emergency medical services personnel and
almost no studies related to lay rescuers. Lay rescuer CPR
rates decreased in some regions during the early stages of
the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and resuscitation outcomes
from OHCA were worse compared with before the pan-
demic.4–8 Availability of PPE may improve laypeople’s will-
ingness to perform CPR.9 The most effective strategy to
protect members of the general public providing CPR dur-
ing a disease outbreak represents a major knowledge gap.
Ethical considerations of performing resuscitation
in the setting of personal risk are discussed in “Part 3:
Ethics.”
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. Systematic reviews identified CPR, bag-mask
ventilation, intubation, and suctioning as AGPs.10–
16 Other studies were less conclusive about
CPR, intubation, and suctioning as AGPs.10,17–20
A human and animal study that evaluated aero-
sol particle concentration during cardiac arrest
found that compressions, bag-mask ventilation,
and defibrillation all generate aerosols.21
2. The use of PPE, including respiratory protec-
tion, eye protection, gloves, and barrier gowns
reduces the risk of infection to health care
personnel.10,13–15,17 In an observational study of
over 1500 health care professionals wearing
PPE for approximately 180 SARS-CoV-2–
positive patients requiring AGPs, only 1 health
care professional became positive in the 2
weeks after the encounter. 22,23 For prehospital
professionals wearing PPE, only 1% became
SARS-CoV-2 positive following care for
approximately 190 patients with SARS-CoV-2
receiving AGP.24
Simulation studies show a delay in CPR ini-
tiation of 30 to 60 seconds to don PPE. 11,25–27
Simulation studies about the effect of PPE on
CPR quality are mixed. 15,28–45 An IHCA study
of 800 adult resuscitations before and after
implementation of a resuscitation PPE policy
showed a delay to initiation of compressions by
20 seconds, 2 minutes for rhythm analysis, no
difference to first shock, 1 minute for epineph-
rine, and 1 minute 40 seconds for intubation. 46
A prospective observational study found simi-
lar first-pass intubation success when intuba-
```
tion (98% adults) was performed by a health
```
care professional wearing full PPE. 47 No differ-
ence in survival was found in this study or in 2
other studies of adult OHCA and emergency
department resuscitation. 48,49 In a prospective
observational study of 3435 adult emergency
department intubations, rates of peri-intubation
adverse events were not increased when full
barrier PPE was used.22
3 and 4. Simulation studies and adult observational
studies of intubations with PPE use suggest
that operators wearing PPE could perform
video laryngoscopy faster than direct laryngos-
copy with similar intubation success rates and
that video laryngoscopy could be performed
with the intubator’s face farther from the
source of aerosols.50–53 One adult observational
study showed increased time to intubation
with video laryngoscopy compared with direct
laryngoscopy. 50 A large RCT of adult intubation
conducted near the end of the SARS-CoV-2
```
pandemic (March to November 2022) found
```
better first-attempt intubation success with
video laryngoscopy than direct laryngoscopy.54
The type of PPE used was not reported in this
study. No pediatric data on the use of video ver-
sus direct laryngoscopy with PPE were identi-
fied, thus, the recommendation for children is
extrapolated from the adult data.

with high viral filtration efficacy on the exhaust
limb of ventilation devices, such as bag-mask
ventilation devices or bag devices attached to
a tracheal tube or supraglottic airway, reduces
fugitive aerosol emissions in the treatment
environment and is, therefore, recommended
by anesthesiology safety groups and other
organizations.55–62
6. Decreasing the number of people in the room
during resuscitation reduces the number of
people at risk of disease transmission. A simu-
lated study showed that although quality of
CPR metrics did not change with less person-
nel in the room, there was a delay in resuscita-
tion task completion with less personnel in the
room.25 An audio link to team members outside
the room enables tasks, such as contempora-
neous clinical documentation and drug prepa-
ration, to be performed by personnel outside
the high-risk environment.
7. Resuscitation team adherence to proper PPE
procedures is often incomplete, and proper
mask fit during compressions can be compro-
mised. 11,22,26,63,64 Just as assigning a team mem-
ber to monitor and provide real-time feedback
about CPR improves CPR quality, dedicating
a team member to supervise PPE use may
improve PPE adherence and, therefore, team
member safety. Ideally, this would be done with-
out exposing an additional person to the infec-
tious resuscitation environment. It is standard
in cases of suspected viral hemorrhagic fever
to have a “trained observer” who is dedicated to
providing real-time feedback to team members
about their PPE use.65,66 This concept has been
tested in simulated SARS-CoV-2 resuscitation
and using remote video monitoring.26,67–69
8. Performing chest compressions while wear-
ing PPE increases rescuer fatigue, and sev-
eral simulation studies showed that wearing
PPE also negatively impacts compression
depth and resuscitation timing. 15,29,30,36,41–45,70–73
Mechanical CPR devices can maintain high-
quality chest compressions while reducing the
number of people required to perform resusci-
tation. Although a simulation study found that
mechanical CPR devices are associated with
better compression quality than human com-
pressors wearing PPE, an observational study
```
of adults with OHCA (421 propensity-matched
```
```
pairs) did not find a difference in survival or
```
neurologic outcomes when a mechanical
CPR device was used compared with manual
CPR with PPE.74,75 No data were identified on
mechanical CPR devices compared with man-
ual CPR with PPE in children.
9 and 10. A case report of a healthy adult volunteer who
had an awake intubation showed that the risk
of exposure to aerosol particles is increased
for personnel within 3 meters of the patient.76
However, a study of 3 adults undergoing intu-
bation showed that the mean particle con-
centrations were 200 to 300 times baseline
during bag-mask ventilation, compared with
30 to 50 times baseline during endotracheal
tube insertion.77 While no longer emphasized
in standard resuscitation, endotracheal intu-
bation redirects a patient’s exhaled gas, respi-
ratory droplets, and respiratory aerosols away
from personnel in the room and contains
them.76,77 No pediatric data on endotracheal
intubation to contain respiratory droplets and
aerosol particles were identified, thus, the
recommendation for children is extrapolated
from the adult data. No studies were identi-
fied on the use of supraglottic airways to con-
tain respiratory droplets and aerosol particles.
11. Intubation boxes, also known as aerosol boxes,
were evaluated in a systematic review that
included 20 simulation studies and showed a
reduction in droplets but not aerosols and an
increased time to endotracheal tube place-
ment.78 This was further supported by more
recent simulation studies with the same con-
clusions, although interpretation of the data
could be limited by box design heterogene-
ity between studies.79–83 Minimizing gaps and
using negative pressure devices may improve
the box’s performance. Patient draping has also
been investigated with similar issues.28,40,79,83,84
Table 2 summarizes the key steps to reduce transmis-
sion of these pathogens.

Synopsis
Hyperkalemia, defined as serum potassium concen-
tration greater than 5.0 mEq/L in adults and greater
than 5.5 mEq/L in children, can lead to life-threatening
cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac arrest. 1,2 While the
prevalence of hyperkalemia in the adult population is
estimated at 2% to 3%, hospitalized adults face a great-
```
er incidence of severe hyperkalemia (>6.5 mEq/L),
```
ranging from 1% to 10%. 3–6 Risk factors contributing
to the development of hyperkalemia in both adults and
children include impaired kidney function, potassium
supplements, potassium-sparing diuretics, angiotensin-
converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor
```
blockers (ARBs), brisk hemolysis, and crush injuries.
```
Acidemia during cardiac arrest can also temporar-
ily cause potassium to shift extracellularly, resulting in
elevated serum potassium concentrations, which may
conflate the etiology of cardiac arrest. 7 Laboratory con-
firmation is not required for initial treatment, although
patient history and electrocardiogram changes can sup-
port suspicion of hyperkalemia as an underlying etiol-
ogy. Characteristic electrocardiogram abnormalities of

hyperkalemia may include peaked T waves, flattened P
wave, PR interval lengthening, QRS complex prolonga-
tion, and ST segment depression followed by merging
```
of S and T waves (sine wave), though the sensitivity and
```
specificity of these findings are low. 8
These recommendations are only applicable to the
management of adults and children in cardiac arrest from
hyperkalemia and do not discuss the treatment of life-
threatening hyperkalemia with therapies such as loop
diuretics and potassium binders.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. The benefits of IV calcium administration for myo-
cardial protection during hyperkalemia in the set-
ting of cardiac arrest are based on an 1883 in vitro
study, a 1939 dog study, and a series of 5 adult
cases in 1964.9–11 Calcium administration alone in
a randomized controlled porcine model of hyperka-
```
lemic cardiac arrest did not increase ROSC (OR,
```
```
1.2; 95% CI, 0.4–4.0; P=0.76) or time to ROSC
```
```
(HR, 1.5; 95% CI, 0.8–2.9; P=0.23) when com-
```
pared with placebo. 12 There are no high-quality
human observational studies or clinical trials evalu-
ating IV calcium to treat patients with hyperkale-
mic cardiac arrest. One human adult retrospective
observational study on the effectiveness of calcium
and sodium bicarbonate is limited by small sample
size, retrospective design, and multiple conflict-
ing regression analyses, leading to low certainty
of results.13 The study did not inform this recom-
mendation. Furthermore, no significant benefit of
IV calcium was observed in a subanalysis of adult
out-of-hospital PEA arrests in which hyperkalemia
was suspected as defined by electrocardiogram
abnormalities rather than prearrest potassium
concentrations.14 Limited data in children seem to
demonstrate findings consistent with adults. In a
separate subgroup analysis of observational data
in pediatric hospitals, 8 children receiving calcium
during in-hospital hyperkalemia-induced cardiac
arrest showed no significant differences or trends
in survival to hospital discharge or favorable neuro-
logical outcome. 15
2. Sodium bicarbonate shifts potassium intracel-
lularly and is theoretically beneficial when severe
hyperkalemia exists with cardiac arrest. In a ran-
domized controlled pig model of hyperkalemic
cardiac arrest, sodium bicarbonate significantly
```
increased ROSC (24/26 [92%] versus 13/26
```
```
[50%]; OR, 12.0; 95% CI, 2.3–61.5; P=0.003) and
```
```
reduced time to ROSC (HR, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.8–7.5;
```
```
P<0.001).12 One human adult retrospective obser-
```
vational study on the effectiveness of calcium and
sodium bicarbonate is limited by small sample
size, retrospective design, and multiple conflict-
ing regression analyses, leading to low certainty of
results. 13 The study did not inform this recommen-
dation. There is a paucity of published literature of
sodium bicarbonate in children, and, thus, recom-
mendations are extrapolated from available adult
data.
3. Insulin and glucose shift potassium intracellu-
larly. Treatment with IV insulin in the setting of
hyperkalemic cardiac arrest has produced vari-
able results and is limited to case reports and
case series. Notably, standard IV insulin therapy
was ineffective in a reported case series of 11
adults and 5 children. 16 However, a recent case
report of 2 adults indicated a potential benefit
```
of high-dose insulin (1 U/kg IV) on ROSC in the
```
presence of hyperkalemia. 17 The ILCOR 2024
International Consensus on CPR and Emergency
Cardiovascular Care Science With Treatment
Recommendations recommends the combina-
tion of insulin and glucose for adults and children
with cardiac arrest from suspected hyperkalemia
based on indirect non–cardiac arrest evidence
demonstrating the lowering of serum potassium
concentrations. 18,19 The use of insulin and glu-
cose risks hypoglycemia and has the opportu-
nity cost of forgoing other potentially efficacious
interventions. Doses for insulin and glucose for
cardiac arrest from suspected hyperkalemia are
listed in Table 3.
4. Stimulation of the β2-adrenergic receptors pro-
motes intracellular movement of potassium by
activation of the Na-K ATPase pump. There are no
data demonstrating additional benefit using addi-
tional β2-adrenergic agonists over basic resuscita-
tion in either adults or children with cardiac arrest
from suspected hyperkalemia. Epinephrine is far

Furthermore, differential effects on serum potas-
sium concentrations may occur over the course of
therapy.21 Excessive β2-agonist–induced periph-
eral vasodilation and the potential for interruptions
or ineffective CPR to deliver inhaled therapy could
negatively impact patient outcomes.

HYPERTHERMIA
Introduction
```
Life-threatening hyperthermia (defined as a core temper-
```
```
ature ≥40 °C [104 °F]) is a preventable cause of cardiac
```
arrest that has multiple etiologies, including exertional
heatstroke, environmental exposure, and medication or
drug overdose. Animal data suggests that temperature
and duration are critical determinants of survival.1–3 Pro-
longed temperature elevation leads to multiorgan failure
that resembles septic shock.1
Children are at higher risk of hyperthermia compared
to adults for several reasons. Children are at higher risk
for heat gain because they have larger ratios of body
surface area to body mass, increased metabolic heat
production, and ineffective sweat glands to dissipate
heat. Young children also are unable to recognize or self-
extricate from hyperthermic environments.4,5
No RCT on cooling patients with hyperthermic car-
diac arrest has been performed. As a result, recommen-
dations are made from data derived from adults with
life-threatening hyperthermia and experimental mod-
els of hyperthermia in human volunteers. The following
recommendations only apply to adults and children with
exertional heatstroke, environmental exposure, and med-
ication or drug overdose. The treatment of patients with
malignant hyperthermia and sepsis is outside the scope
of these recommendations.
Specific discussion of the management of adults and
children with life-threatening cocaine and sympathomi-
```
metics poisoning can be found elsewhere (refer to the

```

```
sections). These recommendations inform the manage-
```
ment of adults and children with life-threatening hyper-
thermia, including cardiac arrest.

HYPOTHERMIA
Introduction
```
Severe environmental hypothermia (core body tempera-
```
```
ture, <30 °C [86 °F]) can cause cardiac arrest as well as
```
findings that mimic death.1 Pulse and respiratory rates
may be slow or difficult to detect, and the electrocardio-
gram may show asystole. Apparent rigor mortis or fixed
dilated pupils may not be reliable signs of death in this
setting.2–4 Hypothermia decreases the body’s metabolic
rate and oxygen consumption, improving the chance of
survival and neurological recovery even after prolonged
cardiac arrest. 5–7
Hypothermic cardiac arrest often occurs in danger-
ous environmental conditions, and verification of scene
safety prior to implementing resuscitative measures is
important. Following removal from environmental expo-
sure and removal of wet clothing, passive rewarming
may include techniques such as providing a blanket, and
active rewarming may include providing a warm forced-
air blanket, administration of warmed IV or IO fluids, warm
humidified oxygen, warm water lavage of the thoracic
and peritoneal cavities, blood rewarming using a kidney
replacement therapy circuit, or use of endovascular tem-
perature control catheters.8–13 Warming through ECLS is
possible at some centers and also provides circulatory
support.
Children are at higher risk of hypothermia compared
with adults due to a larger ratio of body surface area
to body mass and decreased insulation by fat. Infants
cannot produce heat through shivering, and both infants
and children have limited glycogen stores required to
produce heat and are unable to self-extricate from hypo-
thermic environments.14

Cao et al Special Circumstances: 2025 AHA Guidelines for CPR and ECC
In the absence of human evidence, these guidelines
do not make a recommendation about the use of antiar-
rhythmic medications for patients in cardiac arrest from
environmental hypothermia. These recommendations
are specific to hypothermia management. Other specific
treatment recommendations related to the setting of
```
drowning can be found elsewhere (refer to Drowning).15
```
Treatment recommendations related to avalanche are
outside of the scope of these guidelines.
These recommendations inform the management of
adults and children with life-threatening environmen-
tal hypothermia, including cardiac arrest. Other spe-
cific treatment recommendations related to adults and
children with hypothermia that is not immediately life-
threatening can be found in the AHA and American Red
Cross 2024 Guidelines for First Aid.16

3: No
Benefit B-NR
10. It is not recommended to use end-tidal carbon
```
dioxide (ETCO 2) to predict outcomes for adults
```
in hypothermic cardiac arrest.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. Obvious lethal injury (eg, decapitation, truncal
transection, whole body incineration, or frozen
```
solid) are suggested conditions to withhold or
```
terminate CPR. 17 Absent these signs, numerous
case reports and the International Hypothermia
Registry describe ROSC prior to or concurrently
with rewarming in adults.18–20
2. A multicenter prospective observational study of
242 adults with severe environmental hypothermia
showed improved survival and favorable neuro-
logic outcome for adults in cardiac arrest treated
with ECMO compared with conventional rewarm-
ing.21 Multiple retrospective observational studies
of adults in hypothermic cardiac arrest rewarmed
with ECLS have demonstrated a survival benefit
and improved neurological outcome over conven-
tional CPR. 22–24 The use of ECMO is preferable
```
over CPB; a meta-analysis including 464 adults
```
and children in cardiac arrest due to hypothermia
showed a 41% greater probability of survival with
ECMO. 25
3. The Hypothermia Outcome Prediction After
```
ECLS (HOPE) probability score includes age,
```
sex, asphyxia, CPR duration, serum potassium
concentration, and temperature. 26 A HOPE score
<0.1 has been validated for predicting mortality
of adults in hypothermic cardiac arrest placed on
ECLS for rewarming. 27,28 The HOPE score is supe-
rior to serum potassium threshold of ≥12 mmol/L
alone in adults and children. 26 The International
```
Accidental Hypothermia ECLS (ICE) survival
```
score includes sex, asphyxia, and serum potas-
sium concentration, and a score >12 has also
been validated in predicting survival after hypo-
thermic cardiac arrest in adults and children. 29
Other prognostic factors in isolation have been
associated with higher mortality in adults and chil-
dren with hypothermic cardiac arrest, including
high serum potassium concentration, high serum
lactate, low pH, asphyxia, unwitnessed cardiac
arrest, male sex, older age, higher or lower initial
body temperature, and longer resuscitation dura-
tion. 19,20,25,27,30–33 These prognostic factors are less
well-validated than the HOPE or ICE scores. The
ELSO eligibility criteria for ECLS in normothermic
OHCA may miss adults in hypothermic cardiac
arrest who would benefit from ECLS. 11
4. Retrospective observational studies in adults
```
with core temperature <28 °C (82.4 °F) who are
```
not in cardiac arrest have shown successful and
even faster rewarming with ECLS compared with
conventional methods.22,24,34,35 A multicenter pro-
spective observational study showed improved
survival and neurological outcomes with the use
of ECMO for adults in hypothermic cardiac arrest.
```
However, adults with hemodynamic instability (eg,
```
```
not in cardiac arrest) from hypothermia who were
```
placed on ECMO had decreased event-free days
```
(ICU, ventilator, and catecholamine administration)

```
Cao et al Special Circumstances: 2025 AHA Guidelines for CPR and ECC
and increased hemorrhagic complications without
the benefit of improved survival or neurological
outcome.21
5. Defibrillation before rewarming can be successful
in adults, but the hypothermic heart may be less
responsive to defibrillation. 18,20,32,36,37 The tempera-
ture at which defibrillation should first be tried and
the number of defibrillation attempts that should
be made are not well-studied in humans. If VT
or VF persists, excessive defibrillation attempts
may lead to myocardial injury. In a large retro-
spective observational study, while a shockable
initial rhythm in adults in hypothermic OHCA was
associated with better survival and neurologically
favorable survival, prehospital defibrillation and
increasing the number of defibrillation attempts
were not. 38 However, only a small number of adults
with shockable rhythms were not defibrillated, so
the study may have been underpowered to detect
a difference in outcomes in this population. The
Wilderness Medical Society guideline recom-
mends defibrillating once initially and deferring
additional defibrillation attempts until core temper-
```
ature reaches 30 °C (86 °F) when defibrillations
```
are more likely to be successful. 39,40 ERC guide-
lines allow up to 3 defibrillation attempts before
```
rewarming to 30 °C (86 °F). 41
```
6. The optimal rate for rewarming hypothermic adults
with ECLS is unknown. Slow rewarming may delay
the return of organ perfusion, and rapid rewarming
may cause relative cerebral hyperthermia, poten-
tially worsening neurological outcomes. A sec-
ondary review of a meta-analysis of observational
studies and case reports of 658 adults and chil-
dren rewarmed with ECLS evaluated the optimal
threshold rewarming rate. Rewarming rates less
```
than 5 °C/hour (9 °F/hour) had a 2.41 greater
```
```
odds (95% CI, 1.75–3.31) of neurologically intact
```
survival over rewarming rates greater than 5 °C/
```
hour (9 °F/hour).42 Neurologically intact survival
```
```
decreased by 1.9% for each 1 °C/hour (1.8 °F/
```
```
hour) increase in rewarming rate.42 Another meta-
```
analysis of case reports and case series showed a
lower relative hazard of death in adults who were
```
rewarmed at rates between 1.5 °C (2.7 °F) and 4
```
```
°C/hour (7.2 °F), though the former study had a
```
substantially higher mean rewarming rate than the
latter. 30
7. The temperature at which epinephrine should first
be administered and the optimal dosing interval
in the severely hypothermic adult has not been
well-studied. Some adult and adolescent cases of
hypothermic cardiac arrest have normal responses
to epinephrine before rewarming. 18 However, hypo-
thermic hearts may be less responsive to cardio-
vascular drugs, and slowed metabolism due to
hypothermia raises concerns for epinephrine accu-
mulation and toxicity.41,43,44
8. In cases of prolonged CPR or dangerous environ-
mental conditions, it may be suboptimal or impos-
sible to perform continuous high-quality CPR.
Delayed or interrupted CPR may facilitate rapid
extraction or transportation and allow for opti-
mal CPR as soon as feasible or safe. Successful
resuscitation has been documented in adult cases
with delayed or intermittent CPR.45 The acceptable
frequency and duration of CPR interruptions and
which adults can best tolerate this are unknown.
9. Rapid hospital transport is important to allow for
aggressive rewarming with both noninvasive and
invasive techniques. Two studies utilizing the same
database conflicted on the association of low-flow
```
time (time from cardiac arrest to the establishment
```
```
of ECMO) with outcomes for adults in cardiac

arrest due to hypothermia. 46,47 An observational
study showed that transportation to centers with
ECLS capability improved neurologically favorable
outcomes and 1-month survival in adults.38 Adults
have been resuscitated using ECLS after hypo-
thermic cardiac arrest lasting over 6 hours, so the
ERC supports transporting to an ECLS-capable
center if within 6 hours.41,48,49
10. ETCO2 measurement by waveform capnography
is utilized for confirmation of correct endotracheal
tube placement and monitoring ventilation during
endotracheal intubation. For adults in nonhypother-
mic cardiac arrest, ETCO 2 is often used to monitor
and optimize CPR quality, and an abrupt increase
in ETCO 2 can indicate ROSC. In an observational
study comparing adults with and without hypo-
thermic cardiac arrest assessed for ECLS, those
in hypothermic cardiac arrest had significantly
lower ETCO 2 and temperature was positively cor-
related with ETCO 2.27 Also, 45% of adult survivors
had ETCO 2 ≤10 mm Hg at hospital admission and
ETCO 2 value did not predict survival.27

Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. Obvious lethal injury (eg, decapitation, truncal
transection, whole body incineration, or frozen
```
solid) are suggested conditions to withhold or
```
terminate CPR. 17 Absent these signs, numerous
case reports and the International Hypothermia
Registry describe ROSC prior to or concurrently
with rewarming in adults.18–20 Data for chest
compressions for children in cardiac arrest from
environmental hypothermia is lacking, and the rec-
ommendation is extrapolated from adult data.
2. A multicenter prospective observational study
and multiple retrospective observational studies
in adults have shown a survival benefit and favor-
able neurological outcomes with ECLS over con-
ventional CPR for adults in cardiac arrest due to
severe environmental hypothermia over conven-
tional CPR. 21–24 In a case series of children with
hypothermic drowning, survival was better with
conventional rewarming compared with ECMO.50
However, due to clear clinical differences in illness
severity with the ECMO group having lower pH,
higher serum potassium, and longer submersion
time, this case series does not change the recom-
mendation for use of ECLS in children. ECMO is
```
preferable over CPB; a meta-analysis including
```
464 adults and children in cardiac arrest due to
hypothermia showed a 41% greater probability of
survival with ECMO.25
3. The HOPE probability score includes age,
sex, asphyxia, CPR duration, serum potassium
concentration, and temperature and has been vali-
dated in a cohort of adults and children for predict-
ing mortality and ineffective use of extracorporeal
rewarming.27,28 In adults, a threshold HOPE score
of <0.1 has been validated, but there are cases
of children surviving with lower HOPE scores.28,51
The HOPE score may be useful in prognostica-
tion for children with a more conservative lower
cutoff of 0.05.51 The ICE survival score includes
sex, asphyxia, and serum potassium concentra-
tion, and a score >12 has also been validated in
predicting survival after hypothermic cardiac arrest
in a mixed cohort of adults and children.29 Other
prognostic factors in isolation have been associ-
ated with higher mortality in combined cohorts of
adults and children in hypothermic cardiac arrest,
including high serum potassium concentration,
high serum lactate, low pH, asphyxia, unwitnessed
cardiac arrest, male sex, older age, greater initial
body temperature, and longer resuscitation dura-
tion.19,25,27,33 These prognostic factors are less well-
validated than the HOPE or ICE scores. The HOPE
score is superior to serum potassium threshold of
≥12 mmol/L alone in predicting survival in a cohort
of adults and children. 26
4. The optimal rate for rewarming hypothermic chil-
dren with ECLS is unknown. Slow rewarming may
delay the return of organ perfusion, and rapid
rewarming may cause relative cerebral hyper-
thermia, potentially worsening neurological out-
comes. An analysis of case report data from 658
adults and children aggregated in the International
Accidental Hypothermia Extracorporeal Life
Support dataset evaluated the optimal threshold
rewarming rate. Rewarming rates less than 5 °C/
```
hour (9 °F/hour) had a 2.41 greater odds (95%
```
```
CI, 1.75–3.31) of neurologically intact survival over
```
```
rewarming rates greater than 5 °C/hour (9 °F/
```
```
hour).42 Neurologically intact survival decreased by
```
```
1.9% for each 1 °C/hour (1.8 °F/hour) increase in
```
rewarming rate. 42
5. There are no studies on rewarming with ECLS
in children with severe environmental hypother-
mia and not in cardiac arrest, so this recom-
mendation is extrapolated from studies in adults.
Retrospective observational studies have shown
successful rewarming as well as faster rewarm-
ing for adults who are not in cardiac arrest with
```
core temperature <28 °C (82.4 °F) with ECLS
```
compared with conventional methods.22,24,35 A mul-
ticenter prospective observational study showed
improved outcomes with use of ECMO for adults in
```
hypothermic cardiac arrest; however, patients with
```
hemodynamic instability without cardiac arrest who
received ECMO had decreased event-free days
```
(ICU, ventilator, and catecholamine administration)

and increased hemorrhagic complications without
improving survival or neurological outcomes.21
6. Defibrillation before rewarming can be successful
in adults and adolescents.18,20,36,37 The hypother-
mic heart may be less responsive to defibrillation,
and the temperature at which defibrillation should
first be tried in the severely hypothermic child and
the number of defibrillation attempts that should
be made are not well studied. If VT or VF persists,
excessive defibrillation attempts may lead to myo-
cardial injury. In a large retrospective observational
study, while a shockable initial rhythm in adult
patients with hypothermic OHCA was associated
with better survival and neurologically favorable
survival, prehospital defibrillation and increasing
the number of defibrillation attempts were not.38
However, only a small number of adults with shock-
able rhythms were not defibrillated, so the study
may have been underpowered to detect a differ-
ence in outcomes in this population. The Wilderness
Medical Society guideline recommends defibrillat-
ing once initially and deferring additional defibrilla-
tion attempts until core temperature reaches 30 °C
```
(86 °F) because these are more likely to be suc-
```
cessful.39,40 ERC guidelines allow up to 3 defibrilla-
```
tion attempts before rewarming to 30 °C (86 °F).41
```
There are no relevant societal guidelines specific
to children, and, thus, recommendations are extrap-
olated from adult data.
7. The temperature at which epinephrine should first
be administered and the optimal dosing interval in
the severely hypothermic child has not been well-
studied. Some adult and adolescent cases of hypo-
thermic cardiac arrest have normal responses to
epinephrine before rewarming. 18 However, hypo-
thermic hearts may be less responsive to cardio-
vascular drugs and slowed metabolism due to
hypothermia raises concerns for epinephrine accu-
mulation and toxicity.41,43,44 There are no relevant
societal guidelines specific to children, and, thus,
recommendations are extrapolated from adult data.
8. In cases of prolonged CPR or dangerous environ-
mental conditions, it may be suboptimal or impos-
sible to perform continuous high-quality CPR.
Delayed or interrupted CPR may facilitate rapid
extraction or transportation and allow for optimal
CPR as soon as feasible or safe. Adult cases with
delayed or intermittent CPR have led to successful
resuscitations, but there are no reported cases in
children. 45 The acceptable frequency and duration
of CPR interruptions and which children can best
tolerate this are unknown.
9. Rapid hospital transport is important to allow for
aggressive rewarming with both noninvasive and
invasive techniques. Two studies utilizing the same
database conflicted on the association of low-flow
```
time (time from cardiac arrest to the establishment
```
```
of ECMO) with outcomes for adults in cardiac arrest
```
due to hypothermia, but there are no such studies
in children.46,47 Adults have been resuscitated using
ECLS after hypothermic cardiac arrest lasting over
6 hours, so the ERC supports transporting to an
ECLS-capable center if within 6 hours.41,48,49 An
observational study showed that transportation to
centers with ECLS capability improved neurologi-
cally favorable outcomes and 1-month survival in
adults. 38 There is no data in children, and, thus, the
recommendation is extrapolated from adult data.
10. ETCO 2 measurement by waveform capnography
is utilized for confirmation of correct endotracheal
tube placement and monitoring ventilation during
endotracheal intubation. For children in nonhy-
pothermic cardiac arrest, ETCO 2 is often used to
monitor and optimize CPR quality and an abrupt
increase in CO 2 can indicate ROSC. In an obser-
vational study comparing adults with hypothermic
with nonhypothermic cardiac arrest assessed for
ECLS, those in hypothermic cardiac arrest had
significantly lower ETCO2 and temperature was
positively correlated with ETCO2.27 Also, 45% of
adult survivors had ETCO 2 ≤10 mm Hg at hospital
admission, and the value of ETCO2 did not predict
survival. 27 There are no studies available in children,
and, thus, recommendations are extrapolated from
adult data.

LEFT VENTRICULAR ASSIST DEVICES
Recommendations for Unresponsive Adults and Children With Durable
LVADs and Impaired Perfusion
COR LOE Recommendations
1 C-EO
1. In unresponsive adults and children with durable
LVADs and impaired perfusion, chest compressions
should be performed.
2b C-EO
2. In unresponsive adults and children with durable
LVADs and impaired perfusion, it may be reasonable
to start chest compressions immediately while
simultaneously assessing for device-related
reversible causes.
2b C-EO
3. In unresponsive adults and children with durable
LVADs and impaired perfusion, it may be reasonable
to utilize an algorithmic approach to concurrently
assess and respond to impaired perfusion.
Synopsis
LVADs deliver blood from the weakened left ventricle to
the systemic circulation.1 A durable LVAD comprises an
inflow from the apex of the left ventricle, an implanted
electrical pump, an outflow to the ascending aorta, a per-
cutaneous driveline connection, and an external control-
```
ler powered by batteries (Figure 3). The only currently
```
implanted durable LVAD in adults and children in the
```
United States has a centrifugal pump (eg, HeartMate 3
```
```
LVAD [Abbott]) and is fully magnetically levitated to pre-
```
vent mechanical wear and decrease the risk of thrombo-
sis. There are patients living with older durable LVADs,
```
such as HeartMate II (Abbott) and HeartWare Ventricular
```
```
Assist Device (Medtronic).
```
Cardiac arrest can occur in people with durable LVADs
in cases of device malfunction, inadequate device flow,
or low cardiac output of the unsupported right ventricle,
whereas some typical causes of cardiac arrest, such as
ventricular arrhythmias, may be better tolerated. 2,3 Cur-
rent durable LVADs have continuous rather than pulsa-
tile flow, so most patients do not have a palpable pulse,
making detection of cardiac arrest difficult. Additionally,
automated noninvasive blood pressure and pulse oxime-
try can be unreliable. Perfusion is considered adequate if
```
any of the following is present: (1) normal skin color and
```
```
temperature; (2) normal capillary refill; (3) mean arterial
```
```
pressure greater than 50 mm Hg; (4) partial pressure of
```
```
end-tidal carbon dioxide greater than 20 mm Hg. (Fig-
```
```
ure 4). An unresponsive patient with an LVAD without
```
adequate perfusion is likely in cardiac arrest.
Potential concerns related to performing chest com-
pressions in adults and children with LVADs are device

dislodgement and ineffective or retrograde blood flow
through a valveless LVAD during chest compressions.
These recommendations inform the management of
adults and children with durable LVADs in cardiac arrest
beyond the index placement hospitalization. Manage-
ment of cardiac arrest in the peri-implantation period is
discussed in the recommendations detailed in the Car-
diac Surgery section.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. There are no RCTs or high-quality observational
studies comparing chest compressions versus not
performing chest compressions in adults or chil-
dren with an LVAD. The largest study, a retrospec-
tive cohort of 578 adults with LVADs with cardiac
arrest, showed patients who received chest com-
pressions had higher in-hospital mortality than
those who did not, and CPR was an independent
predictor of mortality. 4 In another retrospective
cohort study including 58 adults with LVADs who
had cardiac arrest, there was no difference in
survival in those receiving chest compressions
versus those not receiving compressions. 5 In a
```
case series of 16 adults, 2 of 9 (22.2%) patients
```
who received chest compressions survived to dis-
```
charge compared with 3 of 7 (42.9%) who did
```
not receive chest compressions. 6 There is high
risk of bias in these retrospective studies, with
potentially poorer outcomes occurring in patients
receiving chest compressions due to a delay in
initiation in this patient population and failure of
this subset of patients to respond to other ALS
interventions, such as defibrillation or epineph-
rine. There is also high risk of misclassification of
patients as having a cardiac arrest when not truly
in cardiac arrest. There are many case reports of
successful use of chest compressions in adults

Cao et al Special Circumstances: 2025 AHA Guidelines for CPR and ECC
and children with an LVAD. 7–14 No study reported
dislodgement or other LVAD device dysfunction
after chest compressions. In 1 study, 3 adults
underwent autopsy to confirm the LVAD was
in appropriate position, including 1 patient who
underwent 2.5 hours of chest compressions. 15
Despite the mechanical left ventricular support
provided by an LVAD, CPR can provide tempo-
rary circulatory support in cardiac arrest resulting
from device malfunction or right ventricular fail-
ure. CPR in the absence of LVAD saves lives, and
poor outcomes may have resulted from hesitancy
to start CPR in this patient population. The ben-
efit of immediate initiation of CPR in unrespon-
sive adults and children with LVADs and impaired
perfusion outweighs the risk.
2. Multiple case series and case reports have
reported delays in initiation of chest compressions
in adults with an LVAD, and delays were longer
for patients with an LVAD compared with controls
without an LVAD.6,9,10,12 The most common reason
for clinicians not performing chest compressions in
patients with an LVAD with acutely impaired per-
fusion was a belief that chest compressions were
contraindicated in this population. 5 Delays in chest
compressions have been highlighted as a potential
contributor to poor outcomes. 5,9 While the British
Societies recommend delaying chest compres-
sions in patients with an LVAD for up to 2 minutes
while attempting to restart the device, these efforts
could occur in parallel to prevent delays in chest
compressions per the 2024 ILCOR scoping review
```
(Figure 4).16
```
3. Because of the difficulty assessing perfusion and
uncertainty regarding the safety of chest com-
pressions in adults and children with an LVAD,
several studies and reviews have proposed algo-
rithms for the resuscitation of this population
```
(Figure 4).1,6,9,14,17,18 Signs and symptoms related to
```
poor tissue perfusion, such as altered mentation
or unresponsiveness, agonal breathing or apnea,
cool temperature, and delayed capillary refill, are
important for initial patient evaluation. The pri-
mary consideration for a patient with an LVAD with
acutely altered perfusion is whether the device is
functioning, and this can be assessed by auscul-
tating for a mechanical ventricular assist device
hum over the left chest and left upper abdomen.1
Troubleshooting an LVAD includes assessment of
the controller for alarms, assessment of the drive-
line for disconnection or fracture and reconnect-
ing if possible, and ensuring an adequate power
source connection. 17 Doppler with a manual cuff
or an arterial line can more reliably measure blood
pressure in a patient with an LVAD, and waveform
capnography can aid in assessment of perfusion.
There are no studies demonstrating improved out-
comes with utilization of an algorithm for managing
adults or children with a durable LVAD in cardiac
arrest.

PREGNANCY
Introduction
Cardiac arrest in pregnancy is infrequent, but the rate ap-
pears to be increasing. 1,2 Because of the relative rarity of
the event, the exclusion of pregnant people from clinical
trials, and ethical considerations, most studies addressing
cardiac arrest in pregnancy are observational. Variability
in the populations included in these studies further chal-
lenges the interpretation of literature. The term obstet-
rics encompasses pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum
states, whereas the term peripartum includes late preg-
nancy, intrapartum, and immediate postpartum periods.
Existing recommendations center on maintaining best
resuscitation practices with modifications to account
for the physiologic changes of pregnancy and address
underlying etiologies specific to obstetric patients.1,3,4
Reversible causes of cardiac arrest in pregnancy paral-
lel those in the nonobstetric population in terms of the
```
underlying pathophysiology (eg, hypovolemia, hypoxemia,
```
```
thrombosis). A pregnancy-specific mnemonic (Figure 5)
```
emphasizes the leading causes of death in obstetric pa-
```
tients (eg, hemorrhage, sepsis, and hypertension) while
```
highlighting diagnoses unique to, or commonly encoun-
```
tered in, the peripartum period (eg, amniotic fluid em-
```
bolism, anesthetic complications, cardiomyopathy, and
```
medications such as magnesium infusions).
```
Reported rates of survival for the pregnant patient and
newborn infant vary widely, reflecting differences in the
causes of cardiac arrest, readiness of the clinical team,
resources available, location, and gestational age at the
time of the event. 1,4,5 Optimizing outcomes for both the
pregnant patient and newborn infant requires advanced
planning to ensure the clinical team can provide timely
and effective resuscitation.6
Guidelines for the resuscitation of newborn infants
are provided in “Part 5: Neonatal Life Support.” Ethical
considerations of performing resuscitation on pregnant
patients are discussed in “Part 3: Ethics.”
Recommendations for Team Preparation for Cardiac Arrest in
Pregnancy
COR LOE Recommendations
1 C-LD 1. Establishing a team prepared to manage cardiacarrest in a pregnant person is recommended.
1 C-LD
2. The resuscitation team should access resources,
including health care professionals, their expertise,
and the necessary equipment, to perform a
resuscitative delivery at the diagnosis of cardiac
arrest in a pregnant patient.
1 C-LD
3. Role-specific training should be provided for
health care professionals with the potential to
respond to cardiac arrest in a pregnant patient.
Synopsis
The management of cardiac arrest in a pregnant patient
requires modifications to account for the physiology of
pregnancy, unique causes of cardiac arrest, and the po-
tential need for a resuscitative delivery if ROSC cannot
be achieved. Essential roles of a resuscitation team in-
```
clude performing left lateral uterine displacement; pro-
```
```
viding high-quality, minimally interrupted CPR; managing
```
```
the difficult airway; and performing a resuscitative de-
```
livery.3 If resuscitative delivery is effective in achieving
ROSC, teams may be tasked with the medical and sur-
gical management of life-threatening postpartum hem-
orrhage. Resuscitative delivery may lead to the birth of
a viable newborn infant in need of resuscitation, which
will ideally be provided by a dedicated team experienced
with the resuscitation of term and preterm infants. Timely
access to the resources and personnel capable of co-
ordinating this multidisciplinary endeavor will vary based
on the local environment. The complexity of this clinical
scenario underscores the need for teams to prepare and
train for this situation.
These recommendations inform team preparation by
facilities capable of responding to and treating pregnant
patients in cardiac arrest.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. Team composition will vary according to local
```
resources but may include (1) a team leader skilled
```
in the management of cardiac arrest and aware of
```
pregnancy-specific modifications; (2) an anesthe-
```
siologist or other operator familiar with intubating
pregnant patients and supporting massive trans-
```
fusion; (3) an obstetrician or surgeon with experi-
```
ence performing cesarean deliveries and surgically
```
managing hemorrhage; (4) a designated neonatal
```
```
resuscitation team; and (5) nurses, pharmacists, and
```
other professionals skilled at IV access, medica-
tion selection, medication administration, and other
key resuscitation tasks. 3 Health care professionals

may play a role in settings where this resource is
available. An analysis of 561 cases of IHCA using
the Get With The Guidelines-Resuscitation registry
demonstrated an association between the location
of cardiac arrest within the hospital and survival. 5
A cardiac arrest occurring in the ICU or postan-
esthesia care unit conferred a 3 times increased
```
adjusted odds of mortality (aOR, 3.32; 95% CI,
```
```
2.00–5.52) compared with those with a cardiac
```
arrest occurring in the labor and delivery unit. This
association could reflect residual confounding
based on morbidity burden, but it may also reflect
lack of readiness of the team for cardiac arrest in
pregnancy.
2. Despite longstanding guidelines recommending
```
that a resuscitative delivery (historically referred
```
```
to as a perimortem cesarean delivery) be initiated
```
if ROSC is not achieved within 4 minutes of car-
diac arrest, in most cases this intervention is not
performed in the recommended timeframe. 3,7–11
Institutions and organizations that may be required
to manage cardiac arrest in a pregnant patient
can prioritize developing, training, and implement-
ing processes to perform a resuscitative deliv-
ery rapidly and safely. 6 In cases of IHCA, this will
include summoning an obstetrician or surgeon, if
available, prepared to perform a resuscitative deliv-
ery along with requisite tools for this procedure

as well as the necessary equipment for neonatal
resuscitation. Optimal management of OHCA dur-
ing pregnancy poses significant clinical challenges
and requires performing high-quality resuscitation
while rapidly transporting the pregnant patient to a
center capable of safely performing the procedure.
A population-based study from France evaluated
55 pregnant patients with OHCA and reported that
30-day survival was 14.5% with neonatal survival
rates of 10.0% when cardiac arrest occurred in the
second trimester and 23.5% in the third trimester.12
This underscores the potential for a good outcome
for the patient and newborn infant when effective
resuscitation is provided.
3. Population-based reviews of resuscitation in preg-
nant patients highlight opportunities for improve-
ment. A population-based surveillance study of
cardiac arrest in pregnancy from the Netherlands
demonstrated that less than a third of pregnant
```
patients (4/14 [29%]) received maneuvers to
```
alleviate aortocaval compression. 13 A study from
the United Kingdom found similar results with
```
only 44% (n=29/66) receiving maneuvers to
```
relieve aortocaval compression. 14 Data from the
Netherlands demonstrated improved rates of
appropriate resuscitative delivery before and
after implementation of the Managing Obstetric
Emergencies and Trauma course for health care
```
professionals in the country (0.36/year versus
```
```
1.6/year; P=0.01), but the 15-year time period
```
of the study limits causal inference. 15 Simulation-
based studies demonstrate improved knowledge
of cardiac arrest in pregnancy, underscoring
a need for training as a key step to improve
readiness. 6,16,17

Synopsis
Modifications to resuscitation in the pregnant patient
with cardiac arrest are based on the anatomic and physi-
ologic changes of pregnancy. 3 The growing uterus can
cause position-dependent aortocaval compression when
the pregnant person is supine. Compression of the in-
ferior vena cava leads to a decrease in preload, stroke
volume, and cardiac output, which must be overcome to
enable adequate blood flow.18
The increased oxygen consumption in the pregnant
person underscores the importance of ensuring adequate
oxygenation and ventilation as a part of resuscitation.
Pregnancy is characterized as a compensated respira-
tory alkalosis driven by an increased tidal volume with
metabolic compensation. The increased tidal volume with
the enlarging uterus results in a lower functional residual
capacity. The decrease in functional residual capacity
along with increased oxygen demand leads to a greater
risk of hypoxemia during advanced airway placement.3
If interventions to enhance oxygen delivery and
reverse underlying causes do not achieve ROSC, atten-
tion is then focused on increasing forward blood flow
and decreasing oxygen demand by delivering the fetus.
The primary purpose of delivery is for resuscitation of
the pregnant patient by relieving aortocaval compres-
sion and by returning blood sequestered in the uterus to
the systemic circulation. 19 Improving neonatal prognosis
by limiting intrauterine hypoxemia and its consequences
is the secondary benefit of this intervention, noting that
fetal survival is dependent on either maternal survival or
resuscitative delivery. 8
These recommendations inform the management of
pregnant patients in cardiac arrest.

unnecessary surgery when feasible.10 Resuscitative
delivery most commonly occurs via laparotomy and
```
hysterotomy (eg, cesarean delivery), but deliv-
```
ery can be achieved via assisted vaginal delivery
if the cervix is fully dilated at the time of cardiac
arrest. Associating the performance of resuscita-
tive delivery and improved outcomes is challenging
because selection bias favors better outcomes for
those who achieve ROSC early enough in resus-
citation that the procedure is no longer needed.
Case series, a meta-analysis of case reports, and
a prospective observational study all demonstrate
an increased likelihood of survival of the pregnant
patient and the newborn infant with shorter time
intervals between cardiac arrest and resuscitative
delivery.8,14,20
2. Resuscitative delivery initiated at 4 minutes and
completed by 5 minutes from the onset of cardiac
arrest was first proposed in 1986 and has remained
the recommended time interval for this procedure
based on practicality and available evidence. 21 From
a pragmatic standpoint, a time interval of 4 minutes
allows for 2 rounds of CPR including administra-
tion of epinephrine, defibrillation in the setting of a
shockable rhythm, and attempts to address revers-
ible causes. A population-based study evaluating
cardiac arrest in obstetric hospitals in the United
Kingdom demonstrated a shorter time interval
between cardiac arrest and resuscitative delivery
in surviving pregnant patients compared with non-
```
survivors (3 versus 12 minutes; P=0.001).14 In a
```
systematic review of 94 cases of cardiac arrest,
resuscitative delivery within 10 minutes of cardiac
arrest was associated with 5 times increased odds
of survival of the pregnant patient. 8 In the subgroup
analysis of 57 people undergoing resuscitative
delivery, time from arrest to delivery was shorter in
```
neonatal survivors compared with nonsurvivors (14
```
```
versus 22 minutes; P=0.02).8 This was supported
```
by a review of published cases, which found a con-
sistent association between injury-free survival for
the pregnant patient and newborn infant and early
resuscitative delivery. No delivery time inflection
point or cut-off time was found.7
3. Moving the pregnant patient from the site of cardiac
arrest for resuscitative delivery was associated with
lower rates of ROSC in a small observational study,
though results were potentially confounded by the
inclusion of OHCA cases, which have overall poorer
prognosis.20 A simulation-based study randomized
multidisciplinary teams to perform resuscitative
delivery at the location of the arrest or movement
to the operating room for resuscitative delivery. The
teams performing the delivery at the location of
the arrest achieved delivery 3.5 minutes faster with
fewer disruptions in chest compressions compared
with those moving to the operating room for deliv-
ery.22 In a simulation study evaluating the impact of
transport on the quality of cardiopulmonary resusci-
tation, teams randomized to transporting the mani-
kin to the operating room showed lower rates of
correct chest compressions with higher rates of
interruption compared with the group randomized
to stay in the location of simulated cardiac arrest.23
4. Manual left lateral uterine displacement (Figure 6)
alleviates aortocaval compression while allowing
the patient to remain in a supine position during
the resuscitation. A prospective cohort study used
quantitative cardiac magnetic resonance imag-
ing to demonstrate that pregnant people have
decreased cardiac output in the supine position
compared with the left lateral position at 20 weeks
and 32 weeks of pregnancy.18 Left ventricular end
diastolic volume, left atrial volume, and stroke vol-
ume were higher in the left lateral compared with
supine position, supporting the ability of position
to increase preload and cardiac output. A meta-
analysis including 8 simulation-based crossover
trials demonstrated superior chest compression
technique when the manikin was placed in a supine
as opposed to a left lateral tilt position. 24 One of the
included studies used a porcine model to demon-
strate improved coronary perfusion pressure when
chest compressions were performed when supine

5. The physiologic changes of pregnancy render
pregnant people less tolerant of apneic oxygen-
ation and more vulnerable to hypoxemia, hypercar-
bia, and subsequent acidosis than other people in
cardiac arrest. Providing adequate oxygenation and
ventilation optimizes the resuscitation of the preg-
nant patient while maintaining favorable gradients
of oxygen and carbon dioxide across the uteropla-
cental interface, which is critical to neonatal out-
comes.3 Anatomic and hormonal changes increase
the risk of aspiration in pregnancy, making endo-
tracheal intubation ideal for airway management,
but the likelihood of airway edema contributes
to higher rates of difficult or failed intubation in
pregnant patients. 26,27 The “difficult” airway is navi-
gated with a smaller endotracheal tube by a team
member with expertise in laryngoscopy and con-
sideration of a supraglottic airway after 2 failed
intubation attempts.3,28
6. Theoretical concerns about bleeding and thrombo-
sis in obstetric patients have delayed the use of
ECLS in peripartum patients, but emerging data
support its use. A systematic review of 358 obstet-
ric patients managed with ECLS reported a 30-day
survival rate of 75%.29 Fifty-seven of these patients
were cannulated for the indication of cardiac arrest
during pregnancy or in the first 24 hours after
delivery with an 87% 30-day survival rate.29 Only
13% of patients in this study experienced severe
bleeding necessitating laparotomy or hysterec-
tomy, with a 3% rate of venous thromboembolism.
A 2020 analysis of 277 obstetric patients in the
ELSO Registry found a 55% rate of survival among
the 42 patients receiving ECLS for the indication
of cardiac arrest.30 This 55% survival rate among
obstetric patients cannulated for an indication of
cardiac arrest compares favorably with the 29%
rate of survival for patients receiving ECPR in the
ELSO Registry over a similar time period.31 ELSO
guidelines suggest summoning available resources,
including health care professionals, their expertise,
and the necessary equipment, for evaluation for
possible ECPR after 10 to 15 minutes of standard
resuscitation without ROSC.32
7. Although not directly studied, aortocaval compres-
sion likely impedes delivery of resuscitation drugs
administered in the lower extremities to the central
circulation. A radionucleotide study in nonpregnant
canines found that drugs instilled into the supe-
rior vena cava reached the heart faster than drugs
instilled into the inferior vena cava. 32 However,
```
studies from OHCA (excluding pregnant people)
```
have not consistently demonstrated favorable neu-
rologic outcomes when IO devices were placed
in the upper extremity compared to the lower
extremity. 33–35
8. Magnesium sulfate is a commonly utilized medica-
tion in obstetrics, administered as a bolus dose fol-
lowed by a continuous infusion for management of
preeclampsia and for other specific patients at risk
of preterm delivery. Life-threatening and fatal hyper-
magnesemia due to medication error has been
reported in obstetric and nonobstetric patients.36–38 A
meta-analysis examining adverse effects from mag-
nesium sulfate administration stratified by indication
and regimen found an increased risk of respiratory
depression in patients with preeclampsia receiving
magnesium.36 A study of patients on magnesium
infusions for obstetric indications demonstrated that
increasing concentrations of serum magnesium were
associated with lower ionized calcium concentration
and increased urinary calcium excretion.39 Calcium
administration may improve hemodynamics in the
setting of magnesium toxicity, informing its use in car-
diac arrest.40 Most patients in case reports received
calcium along with multiple concurrent interventions,
limiting the usefulness of these reports.
9. The physiologic dependence of the fetus on the
circulation of the pregnant patient coupled with
the high survival rate of newborn infants in the set-
ting of ROSC prior to resuscitative delivery under-
scores the importance of prioritizing resuscitation
of the pregnant patient. 8 Fetal monitoring will not
change management and may worsen outcomes
by distracting the team and limiting timely defibril-
lation and resuscitative delivery when indicated. 3
Removal of external and internal fetal monitors at
the diagnosis of cardiac arrest avoids these dis-
tractions and minimizes risk of rescuer injury in the
setting of defibrillation.
The 2025 treatment algorithm for the management of
cardiac arrest in pregnancy is shown in Figure 5.

Synopsis
```
Amniotic fluid embolism (AFE) is a clinical diagnosis
```
characterized by sudden hemodynamic and respiratory
compromise during labor or shortly after delivery that can
lead to cardiac arrest.41 The presence of disseminated
intravascular coagulation and resultant hemorrhage is
a hallmark feature of the disease. 42,43 A key feature in
the pathophysiology of AFE involves exposure to fetal
antigens with proteins, such as tissue factor and en-
dothelin. 41 A complete understanding of the molecular
mechanism triggering this hyperimmune response is still
a topic of investigation, but the historic perspective of
the pathophysiology of AFE characterized by fetal cells
obstructing the pulmonary vasculature is incorrect.44,45
Tremendous overlap in the clinical features of AFE
and other common causes of cardiac arrest make a
high index of suspicion, timely diagnosis, and interven-
tions addressing the underlying pathophysiology of
critical importance. 46 Echocardiography evaluating for
increased pulmonary vascular resistance and right ven-
tricular failure along with viscoelastic testing assessing
for hyperfibrinolysis have been proposed to aid in timely
diagnosis.47–50 National guidelines for the diagnosis
vary without a reference standard clinical or pathologic
diagnosis.51
These recommendations inform the management of
pregnant patients with life-threatening AFE, including
cardiac arrest.
Refer to Figure 5 for pregnancy modifications to stan-
dard ALS.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. Balanced transfusion characterized by the transfu-
sion of red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, and
platelets equivalent to the constitution of whole
blood is a cornerstone in the management of
active bleeding and hemorrhagic shock in obstetric
and nonobstetric patients. 52,53 A massive transfu-
sion protocol is an institution-specific response to
expedite access to support a large-volume transfu-
sion of whole blood components in the setting of
life-threatening hemorrhage. 53 The pathophysiol-
ogy of hyperfibrinolysis alongside population-level
data from multiple countries support the potential
need for this intervention in the setting of sus-
pected AFE. 53,54 A population-based study evaluat-
ing cases of suspected AFE in France reported 10
units of red blood cells as the median transfusion
```
volume (range, 0–22 units) while also noting 16 of
```
36 people received suboptimal hemorrhage man-
agement.55 The importance of a balanced trans-
fusion strategy that replaces coagulation factors
along with red blood cells is underscored in a mul-
tinational nested case-control study evaluating the
association between hemorrhage management
and death in the setting of suspected AFE.51 An
analysis of 216 subjects identified by the United
Kingdom Obstetric Surveillance System demon-
strated a reduced risk of death in the setting of
```
transfusion of concentrated fibrinogen (aOR, 0.44;
```
```
95% CI, 0.21–0.92) and platelets (aOR, 0.23; 95%
```
```
CI, 0.10–0.52), noting the importance of coagula-
```
tion factors in addition to red blood cells.
2. Tranexamic acid (TXA) works through competi-
tive binding to limit the activation of plasmin—the
enzyme that prevents excess clot formation in
physiologic states by cleaving fibrinogen to fibrin
and its split products. The hyperfibrinolysis of dis-
seminated intravascular coagulation destabilizes
existing blood clots while generating fibrin split
products that cause microvascular injury. Therefore,
the mechanism of action of TXA is to prevent clot
degradation and downstream microangiopathy—
not to promote clot formation. Two RCTs of more
than 20 000 adult patients each demonstrated
a mortality benefit with TXA administration in
the setting of hemorrhage. In the CRASH-2 trial,
receipt of TXA reduced the risk of death in the
setting of trauma without an increase in venous
thromboembolism.56 The WOMAN trial showed a
mortality benefit in obstetric patients with postpar-
tum hemorrhage, but not specifically AFE, random-
ized to receive TXA.57 International guidelines from
the World Health Organization support the use of
TXA in the setting of postpartum hemorrhage, with
recommendations from the Society for Maternal-
Fetal Medicine underscoring its unique role in the
management of suspected AFE.58,59
3. ECLS with VA-ECMO has been used as a bridge
to recovery in case reports and case series of
peripartum women with suspected AFE refrac-
tory to medical management. 60,61 A retrospective
case series from 2 high-volume ECMO centers in
France evaluated outcomes for the 10 peripartum
patients with suspected AFE placed on VA-ECMO
over a 13-year period.60 Seven of the 10 patients
suffered from cardiac arrest, 2 of whom were can-
nulated during ECPR. Seven of the patients were
alive at hospital discharge, representing 70% sur-
vival in this case series. An ELSO Registry study
reported a 62% rate of survival among the 34
patients placed on VA-ECMO in the setting of AFE
over a 5-year period.62 Reported outcomes vary in
the setting of AFE, with estimated survival rates
predating more widespread use of ECMO rang-
ing between 11% and 44%. 63 The comparatively
high rate of survival in patients with suspected AFE
receiving ECLS suggests a role for this therapy as
a bridge to recovery in this rare disease.

exchange without causing systemic vasodilation,
and case reports have described their use for the
management of pulmonary hypertension during
labor and delivery. 64–66 A case report of the use
of inhaled nitric oxide demonstrated rapid rever-
sal of hemodynamic compromise in the setting of
AFE. 67 These limited data alongside biologic plau-
sibility supporting the use of inhaled nitric oxide
in the unique pathophysiology of AFE suggests a
potential role for this therapy in this life-threatening
disease.53
5. Case reports have highlighted the use of atro-
pine in conjunction with ondansetron and ketoro-
lac for targeted therapy for peripartum patients
with AFE.68,69 These case reports include patients
receiving other interventions and hemodynamic
support making the contribution of this novel regi-
men to the reported outcome uncertain. Serotonin
and thromboxane antagonism with ondanse-
tron and ketorolac, respectively, manifest limited
hemodynamic consequence.68 Atropine has been
included in this pathway regardless of the present-
ing rhythm, presumably because of its role as a
pulmonary vasodilator or its chronotropic effect. 70
Atropine may cause nonselective pulmonary vaso-
dilation, potentially worsening ventilation and per-
fusion mismatch. The increased heart rate limits
diastolic filling time, which can impact the coronary
and systemic circulations, particularly in settings
of right ventricular pressure overload. The lack of
benefit alongside the availability of other vasoac-
tive agents capable of providing chronotropic and
inotropic support inform this recommendation.

PULMONARY EMBOLISM
Introduction
PE is the occlusion of 1 or more pulmonary arteries
and is a potentially reversible cause of hemodynamic
instability or cardiac arrest. Partial or complete occlu-
sion of pulmonary arteries results in ventilation and
perfusion mismatch and increases in pulmonary artery
pressures, causing impaired right ventricular function
and, ultimately, cardiovascular collapse. 1,2 In 1 large re-
view of hospitalized patients diagnosed with PE, mor-
tality of hemodynamically unstable patients was 76.6%
and of hemodynamically stable patients was 10.8%,
highlighting the severity of this disease process. 3 Mor-
tality in OHCA secondary to PE is reported as high as
91%. 4 Most patients in cardiac arrest secondary to PE
```
exhibit PEA (26%–75%) or asystole (19%–73%). 4–6
```
Treatment of patients in cardiac arrest from PE include
systemic and catheter-guided fibrinolysis, surgical and
mechanical embolectomy, and ECMO. Each augments
resuscitation by restoring pulmonary and systemic
circulation.
The diagnosis of PE in children is often delayed
because of diagnostic challenges and differences in
symptomatology compared with adults. 7 Considering
children are able to compensate for shock states with
increased systemic vascular resistance, hypotension is
a late sign of shock in children.7 There are limited data
available and no RCTs to inform the care of children.
These recommendations are modifications to stan-
dard ACLS for adults and children in cardiac arrest from
confirmed or suspected PE. The treatment of patients
with life-threatening PE not in cardiac arrest are out-
side of the scope of these recommendations, although
several studies cited in the recommendations contain
overlapping populations of hemodynamically unstable
patients with PE and patients with PE in cardiac arrest.
Recommendations for Adults in Cardiac Arrest From PE
COR LOE Recommendations
2a B-NR
1. For adults with confirmed PE as the precipitant
of cardiac arrest, systemic fibrinolysis, surgical
embolectomy, and percutaneous mechanical
embolectomy are reasonable treatment options.
2a B-NR 2. It is reasonable to use ECLS in adults with cardiacarrest from confirmed or suspected PE.
2b B-NR 3. For adults in cardiac arrest from suspected PE,systemic fibrinolysis may be considered.
2b C-EO
4. The optimal duration of CPR after administration of
systemic fibrinolytic to adults in cardiac arrest from
confirmed or suspected PE is unclear.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. The treatment of adults in cardiac arrest from
a confirmed PE may differ between institu-
tions depending upon the available resources. In
1 retrospective multicenter study of 104 adult
patients, including 70 patients in cardiac arrest
who received systemic fibrinolytics, patients with
confirmed PE had significantly greater survival to
hospital discharge compared with those with a pre-
```
sumed PE (26% versus 4%; P=0.01). 8 A review of
```
153 adults who experienced cardiac arrest from
PE who underwent surgical embolectomy showed
56% survival.9 One retrospective case series of
hemodynamically unstable adults with confirmed
PE, including patients who required CPR, showed
lower in-hospital mortality for those who underwent
percutaneous mechanical pulmonary embolectomy
```
compared with no embolectomy (64.4% versus
```
```
76.8%; P<0.001). 3 The benefit of systemic fibrino-
```
lysis is weighed against the risk of bleeding com-
plications. One study of adults with OHCA from PE
observed the same risk of death from hemorrhage
in patients who were treated with systemic fibrino-
```
lytics compared with those who were not (6% ver-
```
```
sus 5%; P=0.73). 4 Another study observed 37.9%
```
of adults developed bleeding complications, includ-
ing intracranial hemorrhage in 9.1% of adults.10
2. ECLS, including VA-ECMO, for adults in cardiac
arrest has become increasingly available.11 In 1 ret-
rospective before-and-after implementation study
of ECPR in 39 adults who suffered cardiac arrest

due to suspected or confirmed PE, 19 underwent
VA-ECMO cannulation during CPR.12 Adults who
received VA-ECMO during CPR had higher ICU
```
survival (26% versus 5%; P<0.01) and higher
```
```
survival with favorable neurologic outcomes (21%
```
```
versus 0%; P<0.05) than those patients receiving
```
conventional CPR. 12 In a systematic review and
meta-analysis of 77 studies including 301 adults
who suffered cardiac arrest from PE, 65% of
patients placed on VA-ECMO during CPR survived
to hospital discharge. 13 Two separate retrospective
reviews of adults treated with venovenous ECMO
or VA-ECMO for hemodynamic instability or cardiac
arrest from confirmed PE showed no difference in
survival rate in adults who received unfractionated
heparin alone compared with those who received
systemic fibrinolytics or surgical or interventional
thrombectomy. 14,15 One meta-analysis showed no
increased risk of mortality for adults who received
systemic fibrinolysis prior to VA-ECMO or venove-
nous ECMO cannulation. 13
3. Investigating the efficacy of systemic fibrinolytics
to treat suspected PE is challenging due to varia-
tions in patient enrollment, which often lead to
the inclusion of many patients with cardiac arrest
from causes unrelated to PE. The definition of sus-
pected PE in reviewed studies is not well-defined,
and research is conflicting. Two RCTs found that
administration of systemic fibrinolytics did not
```
improve survival in adults and children (>16 years
```
```
of age) with undifferentiated cardiac arrest. 16,17 In
```
1 retrospective registry study of 58 adult OHCA
patients treated with systemic fibrinolysis for
suspected PE, systemic fibrinolytics provided no
```
survival benefit at 24 hours versus control (66%
```
```
versus 63%; P=0.76); however, a 30-day mortal-
```
ity benefit was identified after the population was
```
appropriately weighted (P=0.005; adjusted log-
```
```
rank test). 4 Two additional retrospective investiga-
```
tions of adults with confirmed or suspected PE as
a cause of cardiac arrest showed no increased
rates of ROSC or 30-day survival with systemic
fibrinolytics.10,18
4. There are no trials comparing different durations of
continued resuscitation following systemic fibrino-
lysis administration to adults in cardiac arrest from
any cause, including confirmed or suspected PE.
The 2019 European Society of Cardiology guide-
lines for the diagnosis and management of acute
PE recommend continuing CPR for at least 60 to
90 minutes after administration of a systemic fibri-
nolytic based upon case reports and case series
of adults who survived after 90 to 100 minutes of
CPR.2,19,20 There is significant variation in the dura-
tion of CPR after fibrinolysis between studies. One
randomized trial investigating the use of systemic
fibrinolysis to treat adults in PEA arrest continued
CPR for at least 15 minutes after systemic fibri-
nolytic administration.16 A second randomized trial
continued CPR for at least 30 minutes after sys-
temic fibrinolytic administration to adults in cardiac
arrest.17
Recommendations for Children in Cardiac Arrest From PE
COR LOE Recommendations
2a C-LD
1. For children with confirmed PE as the precipitant
of cardiac arrest, systemic fibrinolysis, surgical
embolectomy, and percutaneous mechanical
embolectomy are reasonable treatment options.
2a C-LD 2. It is reasonable to use ECLS in children withcardiac arrest from confirmed or suspected PE.
2b C-EO 3. For children in cardiac arrest from suspected PE,systemic fibrinolysis may be considered.
2b C-EO
4. The optimal duration of CPR after administration
of systemic fibrinolytic to children in cardiac arrest
from confirmed or suspected PE is unclear.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. The recommendation for the treatment of children
in cardiac arrest from confirmed PE is based on
pediatric case series and data extrapolated from
adults. One retrospective review of 33 children
```
(<19 years of age) with confirmed PE included
```
3 children who underwent surgical embolectomy,
3 who received catheter-based therapies, and 1
who received systemic thrombolysis.7 Of these
children, 4 experienced cardiac arrest, 2 survived
but the specific therapies they received were
not described.7 Overall, 3 of the children died of
PE-related causes. 7 Another retrospective review
```
of 170 children (≤18 years of age) with con-
```
```
firmed PE included 25 (15%) patients with shock
```
or cardiac arrest.21 Twenty-two of these children
received systemic fibrinolysis, catheter-directed
```
therapies, or surgical thrombectomy.21 Eleven (6%)
```
children in this case series died of PE-related
causes.21 In 1 retrospective multicenter study of
104 adults, including 70 patients in cardiac arrest
who received systemic fibrinolytics, patients with
confirmed PE had significantly greater survival to
hospital discharge compared with those with a pre-
```
sumed PE (26% versus 4%; P=0.01).8 The benefit
```
of systemic fibrinolysis is weighed against the risk
of bleeding complications, which is conflicting in
adult studies, ranging from 6% to 37.9% of cardiac
arrest patients with suspected PE. 4
2. The treatment of children who experience cardiac
arrest from PE with ECLS, including VA-ECMO,
is limited by resources available to individual
institutions and individual patient factors. The
recommendation for the treatment of children in
cardiac arrest with ECLS is based on a pediatric

registry study and data extrapolated from adults.
One review of the ELSO Registry included 54 chil-
dren ≤18 years of age treated with ECMO who
received a primary diagnosis code of PE. 22 The
number of children who experienced cardiac arrest
prior to treatment with ECMO was not described,
however, 13 of the included children were treated
```
with ECPR. 22 Thirty-three (61%) children in this
```
cohort survived to hospital discharge. 22 In 1 retro-
spective before- and after-ECPR implementation
study of 39 adults who suffered cardiac arrest
due to suspected or confirmed PE, 19 underwent
VA-ECMO cannulation during CPR. 12 Adults who
received VA-ECMO during CPR had higher ICU
```
survival (26% versus 5%; P<0.001) and higher
```
```
survival with favorable neurologic outcomes (21%
```
```
versus 0%; P<0.05) than those patients receiv-
```
ing conventional CPR. 12 In a systematic review
and meta-analysis of 77 studies including 301
adults who suffered cardiac arrest from PE 65%
of patients placed on VA-ECMO during CPR sur-
vived to hospital discharge. 13
3. Investigating the efficacy of systemic fibrinolytics
to treat suspected PE is challenging due to varia-
tions in patient enrollment, which often lead to
the inclusion of many patients with cardiac arrest
from causes unrelated to PE. The definition of sus-
pected PE in reviewed studies is not well-defined,
and research is conflicting. Two RCTs found that
administration of systemic fibrinolytics did not
```
improve survival in adults and children (>16 years
```
```
of age) with undifferentiated cardiac arrest.16,17
```
One retrospective registry study of 58 adult OHCA
patients treated with systemic fibrinolysis for sus-
pected PE found that systemic fibrinolytics pro-
vided no survival benefit at 24 hours versus control
```
(66% versus 63%; P=0.76); a 30-day mortality
```
benefit was identified after the population was
```
appropriately weighted (P=0.005; adjusted log-
```
```
rank test).4 Two additional retrospective investiga-
```
tions of adults with confirmed or suspected PE as a
cause of cardiac arrest showed no increased rates
of ROSC or 30-day survival with systemic fibrino-
lytics.10,18 Data for systemic fibrinolytics in children
with cardiac arrest from suspected PE is lacking,
and the recommendation is extrapolated from adult
data.
4. There are no trials available to inform the optimal
duration of continued resuscitation following sys-
temic fibrinolysis administration to adults or chil-
dren in cardiac arrest from any cause, including PE.
The 2019 European Society of Cardiology guide-
lines for the diagnosis and management of acute
PE recommends continuing CPR for at least 60
to 90 minutes after administration of a systemic
fibrinolytic based on case reports and case series
of adults who survived after 90 to 100 minutes of
CPR.2,19,20 There is significant variation in time to
continued CPR after fibrinolysis between studies.
One randomized trial investigating the use of sys-
temic fibrinolysis to treat adults in PEA arrest con-
tinued CPR for at least 15 minutes after systemic
fibrinolytic administration.16 A second randomized
trial continued CPR for at least 30 minutes after
systemic fibrinolytic administration to adults in car-
diac arrest. 17

TOXICOLOGY
Introduction
Over 105 000 people in the United States died from
drug overdose in 2023.1 More than 92% of these deaths
were unintentional. Over time, the population of people
```
with fatal drug overdose is aging; overdose death rates
```
are increasing in people aged ≥35 years and decreasing
in younger people. Although most deaths are due to syn-
thetic and semisynthetic opioids, such as fentanyl, many
different poisons are responsible for these deaths.
Poisoning in this guideline refers to the cellular injury
or death that results from the exposure to an exogenous
substance. 2,3 Management of patients with critical poi-
soning, defined as those in cardiac arrest, refractory
shock, or other conditions posing an imminent threat
of cardiac arrest, may require special techniques and
antidotes in addition to standard resuscitation care to
achieve survival and recovery. For example, patients may
develop hypotension from β-adrenergic receptor antag-
```
onist (β-blocker) or calcium channel antagonist (CCB)
```
poisoning that does not respond to atropine, standard
vasopressors, or cardiac pacing but is amenable to tar-
geted therapies, such as high-dose insulin. Specific anti-
dotes are available for many life-threatening poisonings
but are only safe and effective if given in the proper
```
dose and with careful patient selection (Table 4). The
```
ideal dose is rarely known, and in many cases, equally
well-supported alternative dosing strategies exist. Many
poisoned patients are often ideal candidates for ECLS
techniques, such as VA-ECMO, because temporary cir-
culatory support is a bridge to survival until the poison
can be eliminated, either by natural or artificial means.
Research involving poisoned patients is ethically and
logistically challenging. As a result, much data about
human poisoning are descriptive and observational. Vari-
ations and uncertainty in exposure, history, co-ingestions,
and comorbidities make comparisons based on clini-
cal observations challenging. High-quality animal stud-
ies broaden understanding. Applying clinical research
across species is challenging, and current evidence-
based medicine structures discount the contribution of
animal studies to the level or certainty of evidence about
an intervention.
This section of the guidelines is designed primarily for
health care professionals, but opioid overdose—by far the
most common cause of poisoning death—can be treated
by adults and adolescents in the community with brief
training.
In the United States, Canada, and much of the rest
of the world, regional poison centers can provide expert
treatment guidance for the management of specific poi-
soning cases. Each of the 55 poison centers operating
in the United States and 5 in Canada is supported by
board-certified medical and clinical toxicologists with
specialized training in poisoning resuscitation. Poison
centers provide clinical advice to clinicians and the gen-
eral public about how to manage poison emergencies.
A single number is used to reach the regional poison
```
center in the United States (1-800-222-1222) and in
```
```
Canada (1-844-764-7669 [1-844-POISON-X]).

TOXICOLOGY: BENZODIAZEPINES
```
Introduction
Benzodiazepines are commonly used sedative-hypnotics
for treatment of anxiety, insomnia, seizures, and withdraw-
al syndromes and as a component of general anesthesia
and procedural sedation. Benzodiazepines are implicated
in a large number of poisoning-related deaths, usually
```
in combination with other central nervous system (CNS)
```
depressants, such as opioids and alcohol.1,2 Benzodiaz-
epine overdose causes CNS depression through agonist
effects at the gamma-aminobutyric acid-A receptor with
resultant respiratory compromise through loss of protec-
tive airway reflexes. The subsequent hypoxemia and hy-
percarbia cause tissue cellular injury or death.
Flumazenil, a competitive antagonist at the benzo-
diazepine binding site on the gamma-aminobutyric
acid-A receptor, reverses CNS and respiratory depres-
sion, potentially preventing the need for intubation and
mechanical ventilation. 3,4 However, flumazenil admin-
istration may precipitate refractory benzodiazepine
withdrawal in patients with benzodiazepine tolerance,
including seizures and arrhythmias, likely by removing
benzodiazepine-mediated suppression of sympathetic
tone. 5
Overdose with multiple drugs is common. Flumazenil
may not fully reverse respiratory depression, particularly
in mixed overdoses, and it may increase the risk of sei-
zures and arrhythmias in these situations.
These recommendations inform the management of
adults and children with life-threatening benzodiazepine
poisoning, including cardiac arrest.
Recommendations for Adults With Life-Threatening Benzodiazepine
Poisoning
COR LOE Recommendations
2a B-NR
1. If combined opioid and benzodiazepine poisoning
is suspected, it is reasonable to administer
```
naloxone first (before other antidotes) in adults
```
with respiratory depression or respiratory arrest.
2a C-LD
2. Flumazenil can be effective in select adults with
respiratory depression or respiratory arrest caused
by pure benzodiazepine poisoning who do not
have contraindications to flumazenil.
3: No
Benefit C-EO
3. Flumazenil has no role in cardiac arrest related to
benzodiazepine poisoning in adults.
3: Harm B-R
4. Flumazenil administration is associated with harm
in adults who are at increased risk for seizures or
arrhythmias.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. While isolated benzodiazepine poisoning rarely
causes life-threatening hypoventilation or hemo-
dynamic instability in adults, overdoses usually

attenuates benzodiazepine-associated respiratory
depression in healthy patients receiving a combi-
nation of benzodiazepines and opioids, but this only
produces a partial restoration of respiratory func-
tion. Naloxone reverses opioid poisoning, which is
more common and causes more significant respi-
ratory depression than benzodiazepine poisoning. 4
This is particularly important given the presence
```
of opioid-adulterated illicit drugs 2,6 (refer to the

conditions (eg, chronic benzodiazepine depen-

dence and coingestion of other dangerous sub-

depression showed that 1 mg of flumazenil sig-

*Unless otherwise stated, the route of administration should be intravenous or intraosseous. Maximum pediatric dose should not exceed adult dose. Most antidotes
should be repeated frequently and titrated to achieve control of critical signs and symptoms. The ideal dose of most antidotes is not known and is often controversial.
Large doses are sometimes required to overcome competitive inhibition of molecular targets such as adrenergic receptors and ion channels. Consult a medical or clinical
toxicologist, regional poison center, or topic-specific reference for detailed dosing and administration instructions.

with standard care.5 There are few reports of
flumazenil-provoked seizures in adults with preex-
isting seizure disorder in the absence of other risk
factors.8 While the most common cardiac adverse
event associated with flumazenil was supraven-
tricular tachycardia, ventricular arrhythmias and
asystole have also been reported in adults. 5,9–13
The risks of flumazenil likely exceed the benefit
in patients with undifferentiated coma for whom
medical history and co-intoxications are unknown.
Recommendations for Children With Life-Threatening Benzodiazepine
Poisoning
COR LOE Recommendations
2a B-R
1. Administration of flumazenil can be effective in
select children with respiratory depression or
respiratory arrest caused by pure benzodiazepine
poisoning who do not have contraindications to
flumazenil.
2a C-EO
2. If combined opioid and benzodiazepine poisoning
is suspected, it is reasonable to administer nalox-
```
one first (before other antidotes) in children with
```
respiratory depression or respiratory arrest.
3: No
Benefit C-EO
3. Flumazenil has no role in cardiac arrest related to
benzodiazepine poisoning in children.
3: Harm C-LD
4. Flumazenil administration is associated with harm
in children who are at increased risk for seizures or
arrhythmias.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. Flumazenil (Table 4) has been used safely in chil-
dren when there is low risk of precipitating seizures
or arrhythmias. Two RCTs of healthy children who
received benzodiazepines as part of a procedural
anesthetic demonstrated safety with no differ-
ences in cardiorespiratory status and no seizures
reported in those who received flumazenil com-
pared with those who did not.14,15 Awakening was
faster in children who received flumazenil after gen-
eral anesthesia, but there was no difference with
flumazenil use after conscious sedation. 14,15 A pro-
spective nonrandomized study of children receiving
midazolam for conscious sedation showed 96%
had a complete or partial response to flumazenil
with no significant adverse events, but children
with risk factors for seizures were excluded.16 In
a retrospective study of 83 children with clinical
poisoning who received flumazenil after alleged
benzodiazepine and nonbenzodiazepine poisoning,
no flumazenil-related seizures occurred, and effec-
tiveness was not reported.17
2. There are no specific studies investigating the
effects of flumazenil on respiratory depression for
combination benzodiazepine and opioid overdose
in children, thus, the pediatric recommendation is
extrapolated from the adult data.
3. Flumazenil does not directly affect cardiac rhythm
or restore spontaneous circulation in children.7
4. There are reports of seizure recurrence after flu-
mazenil use to reverse benzodiazepine-induced
respiratory depression after prolonged seizures
in children.18,19 In a meta-analysis of random-
ized clinical trials in mostly adults with presumed
benzodiazepine overdose, higher rates of serious
adverse effects, including seizures and arrhyth-
mias, occurred with flumazenil compared with stan-
dard care alone. 5 Harms were uncommon, and in
most cases, readily managed. The risks of flumaze-
nil likely exceed the benefit in children with undif-
ferentiated coma for whom past medical history,
```
substance use history, and the potential poison(s)
```
involved are unknown.

Synopsis
Direct antagonism of the β-adrenergic receptors in
patients with β-blocker poisoning results in hypoten-
sion from decreased cardiac contractility, bradycardia,
and AV nodal blockade. 1 β-blocker poisoning has also
been associated with hypoglycemia. 2–6 A limited num-
ber of β-blockers cause arrhythmias from blockade of
```
cardiac sodium (eg, propranolol) or potassium (eg, so-
```
```
talol) channels and vasodilation from alpha-1 adrenergic
```
```
antagonism (eg, labetalol, carvedilol). 7,8 Fortunately,
```
while unintentional exposure to β-blockers in children
is common, severe toxicity including bronchospasm, car-
diogenic shock, hypoglycemia, seizure, and symptom-
atic bradycardia were not reported in 1 review of 208
children <6 years of age. 5 No studies have evaluated
the use of therapies specific to cardiac arrest due to
β-blocker poisoning. Therefore, recommendations are
derived from studies in poisoned patients with severe
β-blocker–induced shock.
These recommendations inform the management of
adults and children with life-threatening β-blocker poi-
soning, including cardiac arrest.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. High-dose insulin (Table 4) improves inotropy
in case series of adults and children in car-
diogenic shock from β-blocker poisoning. 9,10
In some case reports of adults and children,
high-dose insulin therapy appears to be vaso-
pressor sparing. Recurrence of vasopressor-
resistant hypotension after insulin therapy
was also reduced or stopped, although this is
not reported consistently.8,9,11,12 Protocolized
care reduces the risk of hypoglycemia. 13,14
Hypokalemia and volume overload are addi-
tional concerns.10,13
2. Successful use of inotropes and vasopressors
is described in a systematic review of descrip-
tive studies including adults and children as
well as animal studies.8 Because they are
readily available and act quickly, vasopressors,
such as norepinephrine and epinephrine, are
almost always the initial therapy for β-blocker–
induced hypotension. Other nonadrenergic
vasopressors, such as vasopressin, angioten-
sin II, amrinone, milrinone, methylene blue, and
hydroxocobalamin, are not supported by suffi-
cient evidence to support a recommendation.
3. Intravenous glucagon (Table 4) increased con-
tractility and improved hemodynamics in case
reports and case series of adults and children
with β-blocker poisoning and in 1 adult trial
involving a nontoxic dose of esmolol.8,11,15–17
However, 1 retrospective observational study
of adults and children did not support these
effects.18 The doses used to treat hemody-
namic instability from β-blocker poisoning are
larger than those used to treat hypoglycemia.
Nausea and vomiting are common, and in 1
animal model, rapid tachyphylaxis occurred
with continuous infusion. 8,19
4 and 5. Adult and pediatric case reports, adult case
series, and adult observational studies demon-
strated VA-ECMO may be lifesaving for adults

Cao et al Special Circumstances: 2025 AHA Guidelines for CPR and ECC
and children with persistent cardiogenic shock
refractory to maximal supportive care. 20–23
Limited pediatric data on the use of VA-ECMO
for the treatment of children with β-blocker poi-
```
soning were identified; thus, the pediatric rec-
```
ommendation for children is extrapolated from
the adult data.
6 and 7. The Extracorporeal Treatments in Poisoning
workgroup based on case reports and mech-
anistic studies of adults with impaired kidney
```
function provides weak recommendations for
```
hemodialysis to manage critical poisoning due
to atenolol or sotalol. 24 Nadolol is also consid-
ered dialysable, but clinical data are lacking. 24
No pediatric data on the use of hemodialysis
for the treatment of children with β-blocker poi-
```
soning were identified; thus, the recommenda-
```
tion for children is extrapolated from the adult
data.
8. Survival after ILE therapy (Table 4) has been
described in adult case reports and case series
with patients with β-blocker poisoning. 25–27
One case of a 7-month-old female did not have
improved hemodynamics after ILE adminis-
tration.28 Two adult cases of severe β-blocker
poisoning, combined with bupropion in 1 case
and diltiazem in another, reported abrupt car-
diac arrest immediately after ILE administra-
tion. 29 An expert consensus recommendation
by international medical toxicology collabora-
tors advises against the routine use of ILE for
β-blocker poisoning. 25 Given pediatric data on
the use of ILE therapy are limited, the recom-
mendation for children is extrapolated from the
adult data.
9. Survival after IV calcium administration
```
(Table 4) has been described in adult case
```
reports of cardiac arrest after β-blocker over-
dose.30,31 These cases are confounded by the
concurrent administration of other vasoactive
medications, and data for isolated calcium
administration is lacking. 30,31 No pediatric data
on the use of calcium for β-blocker poison-
ing were identified, thus, recommendations for
children are extrapolated from the adult case
reports.

Synopsis
```
Antagonists of the L-type calcium channel (commonly
```
```
called CCBs) are divided into 2 pharmacological class-
```
```
es: dihydropyridines (eg, nifedipine, amlodipine) and
```
```
nondihydropyridines (eg, diltiazem, verapamil). At thera-
```
peutic doses, nondihydropyridines have more pronounced
effects on cardiac tissue, including the atrioventricular
node, resulting in negative chronotropy. In contrast, di-
hydropyridines primarily cause peripheral vasodilation.
Amlodipine can cause profound vasodilation mediated by
nitric oxide release.1 These distinctions are often lost when
therapeutic doses are exceeded, and patients present with
severe shock from bradycardia, vasodilation, or loss of in-
otropy. Prolonged effects are common given that CCBs
```
are frequently prescribed in sustained-release forms (eg,
```
```
diltiazem, verapamil, nifedipine) or have long half-lives (eg,
```
```
amlodipine). As a result, CCBs are a leading cause of poi-
```
soning mortality reported to poison centers.2 Commonly
used treatment modalities include atropine, calcium, vaso-
```
pressors, high-dose insulin therapy, methylene blue (a ni-
```
```
tric oxide synthase inhibitor), and ILE therapy. ECLS, such
```
as VA-ECMO, has been used in refractory cases.
These recommendations inform the management of
adults and children with life-threatening CCB poisoning,
including cardiac arrest.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. High-dose insulin (Table 4) improves inotropy
in adults and children with severe cardiogenic
shock from CCB poisoning.3–6 One large
observational study including adults and chil-
dren reported favorable outcomes with lower
rates of vasoconstrictive complications than
vasopressor-only therapy. 3 One retrospective
cohort study of adults and children suggested
that patients with dihydropyridine toxicity may
require more vasopressor support along with
high-dose insulin because of additive vaso-
dilation.7 Protocolized care reduces the risk
of hypoglycemia.3,5 Hypokalemia and volume
overload are additional concerns. 3,8
2. Many adults and children with CCB-induced
shock reported to a poison center registry and in
1 case series received vasopressor therapy.2,9,10
One retrospective case series of 48 adults and
children demonstrated excellent survival rates
```
with the primary use of vasopressors (most
```
commonly norepinephrine at doses up to 100
```
mcg/min in adults), with low rates of ischemic
```
complications.9 Three patients in this series had
cardiac arrest before vasopressor therapy. There
is no evidence to guide the choice of vasopres-
sors. Other nonadrenergic vasopressors, such
as vasopressin, angiotensin II, amrinone, milri-
none, and hydroxocobalamin, are not supported
by sufficient evidence for a recommendation.

with refractory cardiogenic shock or cardiac
arrest after CCB overdose is described in a

case series with reported survival rates as high
as 77%. 11–16 A study using data from the ELSO
Registry of adults with CCB poisoning found a
mortality rate of 40.6%, which is lower than the
general mortality rate of 50% for all adults on
ECMO. 17 The study also found that a pH <7.1
and the use of kidney replacement therapy
prior to initiation of ECLS were associated with
increased odds of mortality. 17
5. The available literature on calcium monother-
```
apy for severe CCB toxicity is limited (Table 4).
```
Improvements in heart rate, blood pressure,
and conduction abnormalities are reported in
adults and children. 18,19 However, most patients
require additional treatments.3,15,18,20 In 1 case
series of adults, high doses of calcium gluco-
```
nate (targeting ionized calcium concentrations
```
```
up to twice normal) appeared to be more effec-
```
tive than lower doses.18
6. Glucagon is an adjunctive therapy for severe
CCB poisoning in adults and children. 3,9,20
Reported response rates are variable, vomiting
is common, and tachyphylaxis may occur. 19,21,22
7. Methylene blue (Table 4), a nitric oxide syn-
thase inhibitor, is described in adult case series
and case reports as an effective adjunct to
treat refractory vasodilatory shock after CCB
```
overdose (involving primarily amlodipine). 23
```
However, responses are mixed, and the effects
may be transient. Data for the treatment of chil-
dren with methylene blue for CCB poisoning
is lacking, and recommendations are extrapo-
lated from adult data.
8. An adult case series and a systematic review
of adult and pediatric case reports with CCB
poisoning identified cases where ILE appeared
beneficial.24–26 In 1 report of 2 adults, the use
of ILE was associated with abrupt cardiac
arrest.8 An expert consensus recommendation
by international medical toxicology collabora-
tors advises against the routine use of ILE for
CCB poisoning. 24 The role of ILE in patients
who have failed other modalities and are in
cardiac arrest or peri-arrest is unclear.21,24 Data
for the treatment of children with ILE for CCB
poisoning is limited, and recommendations are
extrapolated primarily from adult data.

TOXICOLOGY: COCAINE
```
Introduction
The clinical manifestations of cocaine poisoning are mainly
caused by sympathetic nervous system effects. Cocaine
produces a sympathomimetic toxidrome marked by tachy-
cardia, hypertension, hyperthermia, diaphoresis, increased
psychomotor activity, and seizures.1 Cocaine induces tachy-
```
cardia (postsynaptic β-adrenergic receptor agonism) and
```
```
hypertension (peripheral postsynaptic alpha-adrenergic re-
```
```
ceptor agonism) by enhanced catecholamine release and
```
catecholamine reuptake inhibition. The release and reup-
take blockade of norepinephrine, epinephrine, dopamine,
and serotonin also causes the CNS and neuropsychiatric
symptoms of cocaine poisoning.1,2 Cocaine-induced coro-
nary atherosclerosis and vasospasm predisposes individu-
als to acute coronary syndromes.3
The electrocardiographic changes and dysrhythmogenic
properties of cocaine are a result of the effect of cocaine
on cardiac sodium and potassium channels.4 Sodium chan-
nel blockade leads to slowed conductance during phase
0 of the cardiac action potential. As a result, patients may
develop QRS complex prolongation and wide-complex
tachycardia similar to what occurs with Vaughan-Williams
Ia and Ic medications.5,6 Cocaine also causes QT interval
prolongation and torsade de pointes through potassium
channel blockade.1,7 Cocaine-induced arrhythmias include
asystolic cardiac arrest and pulseless VT. Like other local
anesthetics, cocaine blocks neuronal sodium channels.
These recommendations inform the management of
adults and children with life-threatening cocaine poison-
ing, including cardiac arrest.
Recommendations for Adults With Life-Threatening Cocaine Poisoning
COR LOE Recommendations
1 B-R 1. Sedation is recommended for adults with severeagitation from cocaine poisoning.

2. Rapid external cooling with ice water immersion
is recommended for adults with life-threatening
```
hyperthermia (Core Temperature >40 °C [104 °F])
```
from cocaine poisoning.
2a C-LD
3. In adults with wide-complex tachycardia or cardiac
arrest from cocaine poisoning, it is reasonable to
administer sodium bicarbonate.
2a C-LD
4. In adults with wide-complex tachycardia or cardiac
arrest from cocaine poisoning, it is reasonable to
administer lidocaine.

5. In adults with cocaine-induced coronary
vasospasm or hypertensive emergencies, it is
```
reasonable to administer vasodilators (eg, nitrates,

6. It is reasonable to use ECLS in adults with
cardiogenic shock from cocaine poisoning
refractory to other treatment measures.
3: No

7. In adults with cocaine-induced coronary
vasospasm or hypertensive emergencies,
administration of β-adrenergic antagonists is not
recommended.
3: Harm C-LD
8. Prolonged use of physical restraint in adults with
life-threatening cocaine poisoning without sedation
is potentially harmful.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. Sedatives (eg, benzodiazepines and antipsychot-
```
ics) have been successful in treating adults with
```
cocaine-induced agitation.8 Small animal pretreat-
ment and rescue studies comparing chlorproma-
zine to diazepam demonstrated improved survival
with both compared with controls.9,10 One adult
randomized clinical trial comparing droperidol ver-
sus lorazepam for acutely agitated patients from
cocaine or methamphetamine intoxication found
adequate sedation with both medications, but dro-
peridol had faster onset of sedation and required
fewer repeat doses.11
2. Hyperthermia (Core temperature >40 °C [104 °F])
can be rapidly life-threatening in cocaine poison-
ing.12,13 High-quality data on cooling measures for
hyperthermic cocaine-intoxicated adults are lack-
ing, but immersion seems effective. 14 Evaporative
or immersive cooling modalities reduce tempera-
ture more rapidly in adults than cooling blankets,
the application of cold packs, or endovascular cool-
ing devices. 12,15–21 Ice water immersion resulted in
the fastest cooling rates in adults and may cool
```
faster than 0.15 °C/min (0.27 °F/min), which has
```
```
been associated with increased survival (refer to
```
```
the Hyperthermia section).16,22
```
3. Canine studies demonstrate the ability of sodium
```
bicarbonate (Table 4) to reverse cocaine-induced
```
QRS prolongation through competitive binding
between sodium bicarbonate and cocaine at the
sodium channel. 23–25 Adult case reports and case
series describe the successful use of hyper-
tonic sodium bicarbonate to treat wide-complex

tachycardia from severe cocaine poisoning. 26–30
The successful use of hypertonic sodium bicar-
bonate in the resuscitation has also been
reported in an adult case report with asystolic
cardiac arrest and subsequent wide-complex
Brugada pattern. 28
4. Lidocaine administration has demonstrated safety
in a multicenter retrospective observation study of
27 adults with cocaine-induced myocardial infarc-
tion.31 The use of lidocaine for cocaine-associated
cardiac arrest with ventricular arrhythmias is sup-
ported by 1 adult and a pediatric case report in a
17-year-old female patient. 32,33
5. Adult clinical trials demonstrate improvements
in coronary blood flow and myocardial oxygen
delivery in patients with cocaine-induced coro-
nary vasospasm after treatment with vasodila-
```
tors (eg, phentolamine, nitrates, verapamil).34–38
```
These studies did not include patients with cardiac
arrest or in peri-arrest. Adults with refractory isch-
emia from cocaine were successfully treated with
phentolamine.35,39
6. ECLS, including VA-ECMO and intra-aortic bal-
loon pump, has been used successfully to sup-
port cardiac output in adults in cardiogenic
shock after myocardial infarction. 40,41 Evidence
in patients with cocaine-associated circulatory
failure is lacking.
7. While a 2008 AHA scientific statement suggests
potential benefits of β-adrenergic blockade after
acute management of cocaine-related myocar-
dial infarction, evidence to support the use of
β-adrenergic blockade in adults with acute life-
threatening cocaine toxicity is lacking. 42 In con-
trolled animal trials, propranolol failed to prevent
cocaine lethality. 9,10,43 In adults who received
cocaine while undergoing cardiac catheteriza-
tion, propranolol exacerbated coronary vasocon-
striction. 44 In the same human model, labetalol
was no better than saline at reversing coronary
vasoconstriction. 45 In at least 1 case report, the
administration of metoprolol to an adult with
persistent cocaine-induced hypertension and
tachycardia resulted in crushing substernal chest
pain, which was followed by PEA and death. 46 In
a case series of adults with acute cocaine toxic-
ity, the effect of esmolol was inconsistent, fail-
ing to treat tachycardia in 1 patient and raising
```
diastolic blood pressure (possibly an unopposed
```
```
alpha-adrenergic effect) in others, 1 of which
```
was severe. 47
8. Although physical restraints may be necessary
temporarily, their sustained use without effective
sedation is associated with death in adults with
severe agitation from exposure to cocaine and
other sympathomimetics.48,49

Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. Sedatives (eg, benzodiazepines and antipsychot-
```
ics) have been successful in treating adults with
```
cocaine-induced agitation.8 Small animal pretreat-
ment and rescue studies comparing chlorpromazine,
an antipsychotic, to diazepam, a benzodiazepine,
demonstrated improved survival with both compared
with controls.9,10 One adult randomized clinical trial
comparing droperidol versus lorazepam for acutely
agitated patients with cocaine or methamphetamine
intoxication found adequate sedation with both med-
ications, but droperidol had faster onset of sedation
and required fewer repeat doses.11 No pediatric data
on the use of sedatives for life-threatening cocaine
poisoning were identified, thus, the recommendation
for children is extrapolated from the adult data.
2. Hyperthermia (Core Temperature >40 °C [104 °F])
can be rapidly life-threatening in cocaine poison-
ing. 12,13 Evaporative or immersive cooling modali-
ties reduce temperature more rapidly in adults than
cooling blankets, the application of cold packs, or
endovascular cooling devices.12,15–21 Ice water
immersion resulted in the fastest cooling rates in
adults and critically may cool faster than 0.15 °C/
```
min (0.27 °F/min), which has been associated with
```
increased survival. 16 High-quality data on cooling
measures for hyperthermic cocaine-intoxicated
adults are lacking, but immersion seems effec-
tive. 14 No pediatric data on the use of rapid external

is extrapolated from the adult data (refer to the

Hyperthermia section).
```
3. Canine studies demonstrate the ability of sodium
```
bicarbonate (Table 4) to reverse cocaine-induced
```
QRS prolongation through competitive binding
between sodium bicarbonate and cocaine at the
sodium channel.23–25 Adult case reports and case
series describe the successful use of hypertonic
sodium bicarbonate to treat wide-complex tachy-
cardia from severe cocaine poisoning.26–30 The
successful use of hypertonic sodium bicarbonate
in resuscitation has also been reported in an adult
with asystolic cardiac arrest and subsequent wide-
complex Brugada pattern.28 No pediatric data on
the use of hypertonic sodium bicarbonate for wide-
complex tachycardia or cardiac arrest from cocaine
poisoning were identified, thus, the recommenda-
tion for children is extrapolated from the adult data.
4. Lidocaine administration has demonstrated safety
in a multicenter retrospective observation study of
27 adults with cocaine-induced myocardial infarc-
tion.31 The use of lidocaine for cocaine-associated
cardiac arrest with ventricular arrhythmias is sup-
ported by 1 adult and a pediatric case report in a
17-year-old female patient.32,33 No other pediat-
ric data on the use of lidocaine for wide-complex
tachycardia or cardiac arrest from cocaine poison-
ing were identified, thus, the recommendation for
children is extrapolated from the adult data.
5. Adult clinical trials demonstrate improvements
in coronary blood flow and myocardial oxygen
delivery in patients with cocaine-induced coro-
nary vasospasm after treatment with vasodila-
```
tors (eg, phentolamine, nitrates, verapamil). 34,37,38
```
These studies did not include patients with cardiac
arrest or peri-arrest states. Adults with refractory
ischemia from cocaine were successfully treated
with phentolamine.35,39 No pediatric data on the
use of vasodilators for cocaine-induced coronary
vasospasm or hypertensive emergencies were
identified, thus, the recommendation for children is
extrapolated from the adult data.
6. ECLS, including VA-ECMO and intra-aortic bal-
loon pump, has been used successfully to support
cardiac output in adults in cardiogenic shock after
myocardial infarction. 40,41 Evidence in patients with
cocaine-associated circulatory failure is lacking. No
pediatric data on the use of ECLS for cardiogenic
shock from cocaine poisoning were identified, thus,
the recommendation for children is extrapolated
from the adult data.
7. While a 2008 AHA scientific statement sug-
gests potential benefits of β-adrenergic block-
ade after acute management of cocaine-related
myocardial infarction, evidence to support the use
of β-adrenergic blockade in adults with acute life-
threatening cocaine toxicity is lacking.42 In con-
trolled animal trials, propranolol and labetalol failed
to prevent cocaine lethality. In adults who receive
cocaine while undergoing cardiac catheterization,
propranolol exacerbates coronary vasoconstric-
tion.9,10,43,44 In the same human model, labetalol was
no better than saline at reversing coronary vaso-
constriction.45 In at least 1 case report, the admin-
istration of metoprolol to an adult with persistent
cocaine-induced hypertension and tachycardia
resulted in crushing substernal chest pain, which
was followed by PEA and death. In a case series
of adults with acute cocaine toxicity, the effect of
esmolol was inconsistent, failing to treat tachycar-
dia in 1 patient and raising diastolic blood pressure
```
(possibly an unopposed alpha-adrenergic effect) in
```
others, 1 of which was severe.47 No pediatric data
on the use of β-adrenergic blockade for cocaine-
induced coronary vasospasm or hypertensive emer-
gencies were identified, thus, the recommendation
for children is extrapolated from the adult data.
8. Although physical restraints may be necessary
temporarily, their sustained use without effective
sedation is associated with death in adults with
severe agitation from exposure to cocaine and
other sympathomimetics.48,49 No pediatric data on
the use of restraints for life-threatening cocaine
poisoning were identified, thus, the recommenda-
tion for children is extrapolated from the adult data.

TOXICOLOGY: CYANIDE
```
Introduction
Cyanide may be encountered through multiple industrial
sources, including jewelry cleaning and electroplating
or by the metabolism of naturally occurring cyanogens
found in the pits of stone fruits, such as apricots. Cya-
nide gas is liberated by the incomplete combustion of
nitrogen-containing products, such as plastics and vinyl,
during house fires. It may also be ingested as cyanide
salts in poisonings.
Cyanide inhibits cellular respiration in the mitochon-
dria, causing cardiovascular collapse, metabolic acidosis
with elevated plasma lactate concentrations, depressed
mental status, seizures, and death.1 Confirmatory testing
is not rapidly available, and thus, diagnosis and manage-
ment are dictated by clinical presentation.
```
Hydroxocobalamin (vitamin B12a) scavenges cyanide
```
on an equimolar basis to form nontoxic cyanocobalamin.
Hydroxocobalamin has a rapid onset of action, is simple
to use, and is adequate when given alone for cyanide
poisoning.2 Administration of hydroxocobalamin leads
to deep red coloration of plasma and urine, which may
interfere with laboratory analyses and erroneously trigger
hemodialysis “blood leak” detectors.2
Alternatively, sodium nitrite and sodium thiosulfate
have also been used to treat cyanide poisoning. Sodium
nitrite oxidizes hemoglobin to methemoglobin, which then
binds cyanide to form cyanmethemoglobin. 3,4 Sodium
thiosulfate acts as a substrate for cyanide metabolism,
slowly forming minimally toxic thiocyanate. 3
These recommendations inform the management of
adults and children with life-threatening cyanide poison-
ing, including cardiac arrest.
Recommendations for Adults With Life-Threatening Cyanide Poisoning
COR LOE Recommendations
1 C-LD 1. Hydroxocobalamin should be administered toadults with life-threatening cyanide poisoning.
1 C-LD
2. The combination of sodium nitrite and sodium
thiosulfate should be administered to adults
with life-threatening cyanide poisoning when
hydroxocobalamin is unavailable.
2a C-EO
3. In adults with concurrent carbon monoxide
```
and cyanide poisoning (eg, from a house fire),
```
administration of sodium thiosulfate alone is
reasonable when hydroxocobalamin is unavailable.
2b C-EO
4. In addition to administering hydroxocobalamin,
it may be reasonable to administer sodium
thiosulfate to adults with cyanide poisoning.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. Hydroxocobalamin (Table 4) has been demon-
strated to improve the survival of patients with cya-
nide poisoning. One prospective observational case
series included 69 adults with suspected cyanide
poisoning from house fires who were treated with
```
hydroxocobalamin.5 Fifty (72%) of the patients sur-
```
vived. Fifteen patients received hydroxocobalamin
```
while in cardiac arrest, and only 2 (13%) survived.5
```
In a case series of 13 adults and a 14-year-old
patient with cyanide poisoning not associated with
```
house fires, 10 (71%) patients survived, including
```
```
7 (78%) patients who were treated with hydroxo-
```
cobalamin alone.6 The 4 fatalities in this study were
all patients who were in cardiac arrest when they
received hydroxocobalamin.6 Overall, mortality of
adults in cardiac arrest from cyanide poisoning
is high despite hydroxocobalamin administration,
highlighting the severity of disease. Adverse effects

Recommendations for Children With Life-Threatening Cyanide
Poisoning
COR LOE Recommendations
1 C-EO 1. Hydroxocobalamin should be administered tochildren with life-threatening cyanide poisoning.
1 C-EO
2. The combination of sodium nitrite and sodium
thiosulfate should be administered to children
with life-threatening cyanide poisoning when
hydroxocobalamin is unavailable.
2a C-EO
3. In children with concurrent carbon monoxide
```
and cyanide toxicity (eg, from a house fire),
```
administration of sodium thiosulfate alone is
reasonable when hydroxocobalamin is unavailable.
2b C-EO
4. In addition to administering hydroxocobalamin,
it may be reasonable to administer sodium
thiosulfate to children with cyanide poisoning.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. Hydroxocobalamin (Table 4) has been demon-
strated to improve the survival of patients with cya-
nide poisoning. One prospective observational case
series included 69 adults with suspected cyanide
poisoning from house fires who were treated with
```
hydroxocobalamin.5 Fifty (72%) of the patients sur-
```
vived. Fifteen patients received hydroxocobalamin
```
while in cardiac arrest, and only 2 (13%) survived.5
```
In a case series of 13 adults and a 14-year-old
patient with cyanide poisoning not associated with
```
house fires, 10 (10/14; 71%) patients survived,
```
```
including 7 (7/9; 78%) patients who were treated
```
with hydroxocobalamin alone. 6 The 4 fatalities in
this review were all patients who were in cardiac
arrest when they received hydroxocobalamin.6
Overall, mortality of patients in cardiac arrest from
cyanide poisoning is high despite hydroxocobala-
min administration, highlighting the severity of dis-
ease. Adverse effects of hydroxocobalamin include
transient hypertension, skin discoloration, rash,
acute kidney injury, interference with colorimetric
laboratory assays, and erroneously triggering of
hemodialysis “blood leak” detectors. 5–9,18 Limited
pediatric data on the treatment of life-threatening
cyanide poisoning with hydroxocobalamin were
identified, thus, the recommendation for children is
extrapolated primarily from the adult data.
2. The combination of sodium nitrite and sodium thio-
sulfate was more protective against lethality in a
canine model than either sodium nitrite or sodium
thiosulfate alone.10 Adult cases of life-threatening
cyanide poisoning have demonstrated survival
using the sodium nitrite and sodium thiosulfate
combination.11 To avoid excessive methemoglobin
formation, the dosing of sodium nitrite in children
```
or in patients with anemia must be precise; the
```
prescribing information lists specifications.12 No
pediatric data on the treatment of life-threatening
cyanide poisoning with the combination sodium
nitrite and sodium thiosulfate were identified, thus,
the recommendation for children is extrapolated
```
from the adult data (Table 4).
```
3. Sodium nitrite can produce methemoglobinemia,
reduces oxygen-carrying capacity, and may worsen
cellular hypoxia in adults with concomitant car-
bon monoxide poisoning.10 The sodium thiosulfate
alone was protective against lethality in a canine
model compared with controls. 10 A conflicting por-
cine model found sodium thiosulfate alone did not
reverse shock in pigs with cyanide poisoning. 13
No human clinical trial exists to inform the use of
sodium thiosulfate alone to treat cyanide poison-
ing. Adults and children in cases of life-threatening
cyanide poisoning have survived after treatment
```
with sodium thiosulfate alone (Table 4).14,15
```
4. Survival after hydroxocobalamin with sodium
thiosulfate to treat cyanide poisoning has been
reported in adult cases. 16,17 There are no human tri-
als comparing the use of hydroxocobalamin alone
versus in combination with sodium thiosulfate. One
porcine study showed no difference in mean arterial
pressures or survival when sodium thiosulfate was
administered in combination with hydroxocobala-
min versus hydroxocobalamin alone. 13 No pediatric
data on the treatment of life-threatening cyanide
poisoning with the combination of hydroxocobala-
min with sodium thiosulfate were identified, thus,
the recommendation for children is extrapolated
```
from the adult data (Table 4).

CARDIAC GLYCOSIDES
Recommendations for Adults and Children With Life-Threatening
Poisoning From Digoxin and Related Cardiac Glycosides
COR LOE Recommendations
1 B-NR
1. Digoxin-specific antibody fragments (digoxin-Fab)
should be administered for adults and children
with life-threatening digoxin or digitoxin poisoning.
2a C-LD
2. It is reasonable to administer digoxin-Fab for adults
and children with life-threatening poisoning due to
Bufo toad and yellow oleander toxins.
2b C-EO
3. It may be reasonable to administer digoxin-Fab
to treat adults and children with life-threatening
poisoning from cardiac glycosides other than
digoxin, digitoxin, Bufo toad toxins, and yellow
oleander toxins.
2b C-EO
4. It may be reasonable to administer lidocaine
or phenytoin to treat adults and children with
ventricular arrhythmias caused by digoxin and
related cardiac glycoside poisoning until digoxin-
Fab can be administered.
3: No
Benefit B-NR
5. The use of hemodialysis, hemofiltration,
hemoperfusion, or plasmapheresis to treat adults
and children with life-threatening poisoning from
digoxin and related cardiac glycosides is not
recommended.
Synopsis
Cardiac glycoside poisoning can be caused by medica-
tions such as digoxin and digitoxin, plants such as fox-
glove and oleander, and certain toad venoms ingested
as ethnopharmaceuticals or hallucinogens. Patients with
cardiac glycoside poisoning may develop gastrointestinal
symptoms, confusion, hyperkalemia, and cardiac conduc-
tion abnormalities, including atrioventricular nodal block,
VT, VF, or asystole. Although cardiac glycosides include
a range of structurally similar cardioactive steroids, most
data involve digoxin poisoning.
```
Digoxin-specific immune antibody fragments (eg,
```
```
digoxin-Fab) bind to and inactivate digoxin and struc-
```
turally similar cardiac glycosides. Different dosing regi-
mens are advocated worldwide. 1–3 The ideal empirical
dose for cardiac arrest is unknown and likely differs
for digoxin poisoning compared with other cardiac
glycosides.
Standard ALS measures for bradycardia, such as atro-
pine and electrical pacing, have variable effectiveness
in cardiac glycoside poisoning. Prior recommendations
addressing these interventions were removed since they
are included as part of standard ALS measures.
These recommendations inform the management of
adults and children with life-threatening poisoning from
digoxin and related cardiac glycosides, including cardiac
arrest.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. A systematic review of digoxin poisoning in adults
and children found observational studies show-
ing resolution of life-threatening arrhythmias after
```
digoxin-Fab administration (Table 4).2 Most studies
```
report response rates of 50% to 90%, with arrhyth-
mia resolution in 30 to 45 minutes in most cases.2
Although there are no RCTs studying cardiac arrest
from digoxin or digitoxin poisoning, excellent sur-
```
vival (30/56 [54%] patients) was reported in an
```
observational study of adults and children in car-
diac arrest treated with digoxin-Fab. 4
2. An RCT among hemodynamically stable adults
```
and children with yellow oleander (Thevetia peru-
```
```
viana, also known as Cascabela thevetia) cardio-
```
```
toxicity (bradycardia or atrial tachyarrhythmias)
```
showed significant resolution of arrhythmia with
digoxin-Fab, as do many case reports and case
```
series including adults and children (Table 4).5,6 A
```
Cochrane review did not identify any trials in adults
or children with severe yellow oleander toxicity.7 In
vitro studies showed affinity between cardiac gly-
cosides found in Bufo toad toxin and digoxin-Fab,
murine studies showed protection, and some pub-
lished case reports of adults and children showed
apparent response.8–14
3. Survival after the administration of digoxin-Fab
for poisoning from cardiac glycosides other than
digoxin, digitoxin, Bufo toad toxin, and yellow ole-
ander are limited to case reports in adults only. 5,15–
21 No pediatric data on the use of digoxin-Fab
to treat poisoning from cardiac glycosides other
than digoxin, digitoxin, Bufo toad toxin, and yellow

4. There are multiple case reports including adults
and children describing the use of antidysrhythmic
medications, including lidocaine and phenytoin, to
treat ventricular arrhythmias caused by digoxin poi-
soning, with various responses. 22–24 No high-quality
cohort studies or randomized trials have evaluated
their effect.
5. A systematic review of adults and children receiv-
ing extracorporeal treatment for digoxin poisoning
found that digoxin is not well removed because of
its large volume of distribution. 25

and ventricular arrhythmias.1–3 Cardiovascular and CNS
toxicity can occur both in isolation and concomitantly.3–5
Local anesthetics vary in toxicity depending on the
potency associated with their lipophilic side chains. At
```
equal doses (eg, mg/kg), bupivacaine is a more potent
```
cardiotoxin than lidocaine and ropivacaine through its
greater affinity and binding durations to cardiac sodium
channels.6,7 However, at equipotent doses, all local anes-
thetics can precipitate toxicity. 2–4,8
Both hypoxia and acidemia are associated with increased
toxicity from bupivacaine in animal models.9–11 As such,
airway management and circulatory support are critical to
```
resuscitation from LAST. Pharmacological interventions (eg,
```
```
ILE, sodium bicarbonate) and mechanical support (eg, VA-
```
```
ECMO) in addition to ACLS have been used for LAST.
```
Evidence-based dosing recommendations for ILE are
lacking. The majority of animal studies and human expe-
rience for the treatment of LAST use 20% ILE. 9 Attempts
```
to reproduce this dose using propofol (which contains 10
```
```
mg/mL propofol in 10% ILE) would be at 10 to 20 times
```
the induction dose for general anesthesia and lead to
serious CNS and cardiovascular adverse effects.
Local anesthetic poisoning can also produce methe-
```
moglobinemia; treatment recommendations are provided
```
in the Toxicology: Methemoglobinemia section.
These recommendations inform the management of
adults and children with life-threatening local anesthetic
poisoning, including cardiac arrest.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. Early administration of 20% ILE (Table 4) in
patients with LAST is supported by animal studies,
```
case reports (including in children and pregnant
```
```
women), and registry studies.1,4,9,12–19 In conjunction
```
with prevention of hypoxia and acidemia through
standard ALS measures, administration of ILE has
been associated with successful resuscitation in
these studies. The descriptive studies are subject
to publication bias with only a few case reports
where ILE failed to resuscitate patients with LAST
associated with lidocaine, mepivacaine, and ropiva-
```
caine. 20–23 Three RCTs (n=40 volunteers) demon-
```
strate a potential pharmacokinetic benefit of ILE
for ropivacaine, levobupivacaine, bupivacaine, and
lidocaine. These 3 studies found that coadministra-
tion of ILE decreased the maximum plasma con-
centration of ropivacaine, the concentration curve
for lidocaine, and the context-sensitive half-life of
bupivacaine.12,24,25 This is consistent with animal
models of the same phenomenon.26,27
2. In the case of isolated CNS toxicity, LAST may prog-
ress rapidly to cardiovascular toxicity. Seizures asso-
ciated with LAST may worsen hypoxia and acidemia,
increasing the risk of cardiotoxicity.11 Administration
of benzodiazepines can abort seizure-like activity
and is commonly reported as part of a therapeutic
regimen in adults and children.2,15,28
3. Sodium bicarbonate administration (Table 4) may
overcome sodium channel blockade by local anes-
thetics and correct acidemia. Evidence to support
the use of sodium bicarbonate is limited to case
reports in adults and children as part of a thera-
peutic regimen.15,28 However, some case reports
showed limited efficacy in adults already in cardiac
arrest.29,30 There are multiple porcine RCTs demon-
strating effective shortening of the QRS interval in
bupivacaine and ropivacaine toxicity.31,32
4. Several case reports in adults and children describe
successful use of mechanical circulatory sup-
port, such as CPB or VA-ECMO, for patients with
LAST and refractory cardiogenic shock.29,30,33–36
Unfortunately, lack of widespread availability of
VA-ECMO limits use of these interventions.

1. For adults and children with life-threatening
methemoglobinemia, methylene blue should be
administered.
2b C-EO
2. Exchange transfusion may be reasonable as
a treatment for adults and children with life-
threatening methemoglobinemia that is not
responsive to methylene blue.

3. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy may be reasonable
as a treatment for adults and children with
life-threatening methemoglobinemia that is not
responsive to methylene blue.

4. For adults and children with life-threatening
methemoglobinemia, it may be reasonable to
administer ascorbic acid only when methylene
blue is contraindicated or not available.
3: No

5. N-acetylcysteine is not recommended as
a treatment for adults with life-threatening
methemoglobinemia.
Synopsis
Acquired methemoglobinemia occurs after exposure to
an oxidant stressor that oxidizes iron in the hemoglobin
```
molecule from the ferrous (Fe2+) state to the ferric (Fe3+)
```
state. In the ferric state, hemoglobin no longer effectively
binds and delivers oxygen to end organs. Common sourc-
es of oxidant stress that can cause methemoglobinemia
```
include nitrates, nitrites, and many pharmaceuticals (eg,
```
```
benzocaine, dapsone, phenazopyridine). 1–9 Patients with
```
methemoglobinemia can appear cyanotic and dusky and
complain of shortness of breath and fatigue. Frequently,
a difference is observed between the oxygen saturation
measured by pulse oximetry versus arterial blood gas.
Although moderate methemoglobinemia is generally
well-tolerated, severe methemoglobinemia can lead to
cardiovascular collapse and death.5,6,9
The most widely accepted treatment for methemoglo-
binemia is methylene blue, which acts as a cofactor to
reduce methemoglobin to hemoglobin.10 Other treatment
modalities that have been described include exchange
transfusion, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, and ascorbic

acid. No studies have examined the treatment of methe-
moglobinemia in the context of cardiac arrest.
These recommendations inform the management of
adults and children with life-threatening methemoglobin-
emia, including cardiac arrest.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. No randomized trial has evaluated methylene blue
```
for the treatment for methemoglobinemia; however,
```
observational studies and published case reports
in adults and children consistently demonstrate
that methylene blue effectively reverses methe-
```
moglobinemia (Table 4).1–4,7,11–13 Methylene blue
```
may not improve methemoglobinemia and may
lead to hemolysis in patients who have glucose-
6- phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, which is
present in about 2% of the US population. 13–17
2. Exchange transfusion has been used success-
fully in case reports and case series in adults and
children to treat methemoglobinemia and may be
appropriate in patients for whom methylene blue is
ineffective.18–24
3. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy has been used as
monotherapy and in conjunction with other thera-
pies in adults. Reduction of methemoglobinemia
concentrations, however, can be delayed up to
several hours. 25–27 Not all health care facilities will
have hyperbaric oxygen therapy available, and its
use may be impractical in the setting of cardio-
pulmonary collapse or cardiac arrest. There are
no published pediatric cases of the use of hyper-
baric oxygen therapy for methemoglobinemia.
Recommendations for children are extrapolated
from adult case reports.
4. Ascorbic acid, or vitamin C, has been used to treat
methemoglobinemia. 23,28–32 Most published case
reports in adults and children demonstrate its use
in conjunction with other treatment modalities or
as an alternative when methylene blue is contrain-
dicated or unavailable. The clinical effect of ascor-
bic acid, however, is slow, often requires multiple
doses over several hours, and might require higher
doses to achieve similar reductions on methemo-
globin.5,28–30,32–34 It is, therefore, unlikely to have
benefit when used alone in resuscitation situations.
5. N-acetylcysteine did not reduce sodium nitrite–
induced methemoglobinemia in a double-blind
crossover adult volunteer study. 35 No pediatric data
on the use of N-acetylcysteine were identified.

TOXICOLOGY: OPIOID OVERDOSE
```
Introduction
Opioid poisoning continues in the United States and
other countries at epidemic levels.1 Most opioid overdose
deaths are unintentional, which underscores the need
to develop and implement evidence-based interventions
for primary prevention, emergency treatment, and re-
covery support for people with substance use disorder.
Response to life-threatening opioid overdose is a critical
resuscitation skill.
In formulating these recommendations, the writing
group reviewed prior AHA publications about opioid over-
dose resuscitation and a 2024 ILCOR systematic review
and performed a structured literature review through
November 2024.2–9 We acknowledge the contributions
of the authors of prior AHA opioid overdose recommen-
dations, members of the 2025 Adult Basic Life Support
Writing Group, and Dr. Matthew Neth for their contribu-
tions to the Toxicology: Opioid Overdose section.2–4,6–9
Recommendations about training of the lay rescuers
for opioid overdose recognition and response are pro-
vided in “Part 12: Resuscitation Education Science.” The
treatment of opioid-induced respiratory depression in
newborn infants is outside the scope of these guidelines.
Recommendations for Adults and Children With Life-Threatening
Opioid Overdose
COR LOE Recommendations
1 B-NR
1. For trained rescuers assisting an adult or child with
suspected opioid overdose who has respiratory de-
pression or respiratory arrest and has a definite pulse,
breaths or bag-mask ventilation should be provided.
1 B-NR
2. For lay rescuers assisting an adult or child with
suspected opioid overdose who is unresponsive
and not breathing normally, CPR with breaths
should be provided.
1 B-NR
3. For trained rescuers assisting an adult or child
with suspected opioid overdose in respiratory ar-
```
rest with a definite pulse, an opioid antagonist (eg,
```
```
naloxone) should be administered.
```
1 C-EO
4. Lay and trained rescuers should not delay per-
forming standard resuscitation or activating the
emergency response system while administering
```
an opioid antagonist (eg, naloxone) or awaiting the
```
person’s response to an opioid antagonist.
2b B-NR
5. For lay and trained rescuers, opioid antagonist
administration may be reasonable for adults in
cardiac arrest with suspected opioid overdose,
```
provided that opioid antagonist (eg, naloxone)
```
administration does not interfere with the delivery
of standard resuscitation including high-quality
compression-ventilation CPR.
2b C-EO
6. For lay and trained rescuers, opioid antagonist
administration may be reasonable for children in
cardiac arrest with suspected opioid overdose,
```
provided that opioid antagonist (eg, naloxone)
```
administration does not interfere with the delivery
of standard resuscitation including high-quality
compression-ventilation CPR.
Synopsis
Opioid overdose causes CNS and respiratory depression,
progressing to respiratory arrest and ultimately cardiac
arrest.4 Most opioid deaths involve additional substances
that contribute to respiratory depression.10–15 Differenti-
ating opioid overdose from other causes of cardiac and
respiratory arrest can be difficult without an accurate his-
tory, which is often unavailable. 16 The mainstay of care
remains early recognition, activation of the emergency
response system, provision of breaths or ventilations, and
the administration of opioid antagonists for adults and
```
children in respiratory arrest (Figures 7 and 8).
```
Opioid antagonists can restore spontaneous respira-
tions and protective airway reflexes in adults and children
with respiratory depression or respiratory arrest from opi-
oid overdose. For adults with cardiac arrest from opioid
overdose, observational studies of naloxone administra-
tion have mixed results.5
Two opioid antagonists, naloxone and nalmefene, are
currently available for reversal in the United States.17 Both
are high potency antagonists of the mu-opioid receptor.
Naloxone is currently available for purchase with or with-
out a prescription in the United States and Canada. 18,19

Intranasal nalmefene is available by prescription only. 20
To date, the published clinical data are more robust for
naloxone than nalmefene.
These recommendations inform the management of
adults and children with life-threatening opioid poison-
ing, including respiratory depression, respiratory arrest,
and cardiac arrest.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1, 2, and 4. Initial management of opioid overdose
should focus on support of the person’s air-
way and breathing, as described in “Part
6: Pediatric BLS” and “Part 7: Adult BLS.”
Respiratory depression and respiratory arrest
can be treated by opening the airway and
providing breaths or ventilations, which may
be all that is needed to prevent deterioration
to cardiac arrest. CPR is indicated for any
adult or child in known or suspected cardiac
arrest, including in trained rescuer situations
in which a definite pulse is not felt and in lay
rescuer situations in which a pulse check
is not performed. Opioid antagonists may
require several minutes and repeated doses
to reverse respiratory arrest, particularly when
administered by the intranasal or IM route.21–
23 Nonopioid sedatives commonly contribute
to respiratory depression and are typically not
reversed by opioid antagonists. Opioid antago-
nists are extremely unlikely to benefit an adult
or child in cardiac arrest who is not receiving
CPR and do not reverse VF. For these reasons,
standard BLS or ALS resuscitation should be
provided immediately and continued until the
adult or child is awake and breathing normally.
Initiating compression-ventilation CPR before
opioid antagonist administration differs from
that of the prescribing information for nalox-
one or nalmefene.19,20 The rationale to initi-
ate standard resuscitation first and continue
until the adult or child is breathing normally
is articulated in this chapter and in prior AHA
publications.3

reflexes and reverse respiratory arrest from

depression in adults and children with opi-
oid overdose when opioid antagonists are
```
administered (for dosing, see Table 4).22–56
```
No studies compared opioid antagonist
administration to standard resuscitation or
ventilatory support alone. Major complica-
tions are rare and dose related.
5 and 6. No clinical trials have evaluated the role of
opioid antagonists in adults or children with
cardiac arrest. The results of animal studies
and adult observational studies of naloxone
administration in undifferentiated cardiac
arrest or cardiac arrest with suspected opioid
overdose are conflicting and highly suscep-
tible to confounding by indication.57–64 As a
result, the overall certainty of the evidence
surrounding a potential role for opioid antago-
nist administration for adults in cardiac arrest
is very low.5 However, no human study has
clearly demonstrated harm from naloxone
administration in cardiac arrest. Pediatric data
are sparse, and recommendations for children
are extrapolated from adult studies. Identifying
opioid overdose as the underlying cause of
cardiac arrest may not always be obvious to
the rescuer. Furthermore, resuscitation emer-
gencies are task-saturated events. It is impor-
tant that interventions with proven benefit,
such as high-quality compression-ventilation
CPR, be prioritized over interventions such
as opioid antagonists, which do not have
established benefit for adults and children in
cardiac arrest and are unlikely to work in the
absence of cardiac output.5 For dosing infor-
mation in adults and children, refer to Table 4.
Recommendations for Adults and Children With Opioid Overdose
Following Successful Response to Opioid Antagonists
COR LOE Recommendations
1 C-LD
1. Adults with opioid overdose who respond to
```
opioid antagonists (eg, naloxone) should be
```
observed in a health care setting until a low risk
of recurrent respiratory depression, normal level
of consciousness, and normal vital signs are
achieved.
1 C-EO
2. Children with opioid overdose who respond
```
to opioid antagonists (eg, naloxone) should be
```
observed in a health care setting until a low risk of
recurrent respiratory depression, normal level of
consciousness, and normal vital signs are achieved.
2a C-LD
3. Repeated doses of opioid antagonists (eg,
```
naloxone) can be beneficial in adults with opioid
```
overdose who respond to opioid antagonists and
develop recurrent respiratory depression.
2a C-EO
4. Repeated doses of opioid antagonists (eg,
```
naloxone) can be beneficial in children with opioid
```
overdose who respond to opioid antagonists and
develop recurrent respiratory depression.
Synopsis
People with opioid overdose who respond to opioid an-
tagonist therapy may develop recurrent respiratory de-
pression if the duration of action of the opioid exceeds
the duration of the antagonist.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1–4. Adults and children with respiratory depression
or respiratory arrest who respond to an opioid
antagonist may develop recurrent CNS and respi-
ratory depression. In 1 study, recurrent respiratory
depression occurred in 72% of patients treated
with titrated low doses of IV naloxone. 65 The ideal
duration of observation is unknown and likely dif-
fers based on the substance involved, which may
```
be unknown; the dose and route of opioid antag-
```
```
onist administration; and whether the patient
```
received naloxone or nalmefene. Although abbre-
viated observation periods may be adequate for
adults with fentanyl, morphine, or heroin over-
dose, a period of observation may be required to
safely discharge an adult with a life-threatening
overdose of a long-acting or sustained-release
opioid. 26,49,53,66–74 Treatment options for recurrent
respiratory depression include repeat doses of
an opioid antagonist or an IV infusion of nalox-
```
one (Table 4). 49,67,69,74,75 No studies were identified
```
to inform the minimum safe observation period
for a child treated with opioid antagonists or the
efficacy of opioid antagonists for recurrent respi-
ratory depression in children, thus, recommenda-
tions are extrapolated from adult data.
Recommendations for Opioid Antagonist Education and Distribution
Following Treatment for Opioid Overdose
COR LOE Recommendation
1 C-LD
1. Adults who are treated for opioid overdose should
```
receive an opioid antagonist (eg, naloxone) and
```
teaching at the time of discharge from a health
care setting.
1 C-EO
2. Children who are treated for opioid overdose, or
their caregivers as appropriate, should receive an
```
opioid antagonist (eg, naloxone) and teaching at
```
the time of discharge from a health care setting.
Synopsis
People who survive an opioid overdose are at increased
risk of a subsequent overdose. Secondary and tertiary pre-
vention strategies include screening, brief intervention, and
```
referral to treatment (SBIRT); providing or prescribing opi-
```
```
oid antagonists such as “take-home naloxone” programs;
```
and prescribing medications for opioid use disorder.76
These recommendations specifically relate to provision
or prescribing of naloxone to opioid overdose survivors
at the time of discharge from the emergency department

or hospital. A 2024 scoping review summarizes 12 stud-
```
ies of programs that distribute (“take-home naloxone”)
```
or prescribe opioid antagonists to patients at the time of
discharge from the emergency department or hospital fol-
lowing treatment for opioid overdose.77 Although the pro-
grams contained many different components, naloxone
distribution was widely accepted by adults and children in
these studies. Naloxone kits were used more than 90 000
times over a 4-year period to reverse opioid overdoses
in British Columbia.78 In a US emergency medical ser-
vices–based study, 24 000 adults and children received
layperson-administered naloxone over a 2-year period.79
Observational studies show that community-based nalox-
one distribution programs are associated with lower opioid
overdose death rates and are cost-effective.80,81
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1 and 2. Adults and children who survive opioid over-
dose are at high risk of subsequent fatal over-
dose. 82–85 The highest risk period is the first
several days after the initial overdose, and the
risk of overdose mortality remains high for at
least a year. A 2016 systematic review found
that take-home naloxone programs align with
the Bradford Hill viewpoints for causality
```
between exposure (opioid antagonist distribu-
```
```
tion) and outcome (reduced opioid overdose
```
```
mortality). 86 In those studies that reported the
```
age of participants, the majority of participants
were adults. Pediatric recommendations are,
therefore, extrapolated from adult data.

Synopsis
Organophosphates and carbamates—found in pesticides,
nerve agents, and some medications—inhibit acetylcho-
linesterase, resulting in muscarinic and nicotinic toxic-
```
ity. They produce parasympathetic excess (bradycardia,
```
bronchorrhea, bronchospasm, diaphoresis, diarrhea,
```
hypersalivation, lacrimation, miosis, urination, vomiting),
```
```
nicotinic excess (mydriasis, tachycardia, muscle fascicu-
```
lations progressing to depolarizing neuromuscular block-
```
ade and paralysis), and CNS effects (altered mental
```
```
status, central apnea, seizures).
```
Early and effective treatment may prevent dete-
rioration to respiratory and cardiac arrest. Treatments
include decontamination, atropine, benzodiazepines, and
oximes. 1
Atropine blocks parasympathetic overstimulation,
mitigating bronchorrhea, bradycardia, bronchospasm,
and CNS effects. Atropine does not block acetylcholine
excess at the neuromuscular junction or nicotinic ganglia
and, therefore, does not reverse paralysis. When admin-
istered early, oximes reactivate the acetylcholinesterase
enzyme, reversing nicotinic effects to slowly improve
respiratory and skeletal muscle strength, although this
effect may be organophosphate specific.2–5 Hemoperfu-
sion or adsorption for organophosphate poisoning has
been evaluated but is not available in North America.6
The evidence for the treatment of cholinesterase
poisoning primarily involves adults and children with
organophosphate poisoning. The basis for the treatment
of patients with life-threatening carbamate poisoning is
extrapolated from the limited evidence for carbamate
poisoning and indirectly from evidence for organophos-
phate poisoning.
These recommendations inform the management of
adults and children with life-threatening organophos-
phate or carbamate poisoning, including cardiac arrest.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. For adults and children with life-threatening
organophosphate or carbamate poisoning
including cardiac arrest, bradycardia, hypoten-
sion, bronchorrhea, or bronchospasm, early
atropine administration improved survival in
1 clinical trial. 7 Much larger doses of atropine
are often required for this indication than for
```
typical bradycardia (Table 4). The initial dose is
```
doubled every 5 minutes until full atropinization
```
is achieved (clear chest on auscultation; heart
```
```
rate >80/min; systolic blood pressure >80
```
```
mm Hg). Maintenance of atropinization can be
```
```
achieved by an atropine infusion (Table 4).7
```
2 and 3. Observational data, mostly in adults, show that
patients who are intubated early in the course of
organophosphate or carbamate poisoning have
shorter durations of intubation than those who
are intubated later in their course.8,9 Whether
this is due to prevention of aspiration pneumo-
nia, differences in pathophysiology of respira-
tory failure, or some other cause is not known.
Minimal pediatric data on airway management
with organophosphate or carbamate poisoning
```
were identified; thus, the recommendation for
```
children is extrapolated from adult data.
4. Benzodiazepines, such as diazepam (first
```
line) or midazolam, have demonstrated
```
efficacy for treating organophosphate or
carbamate-induced seizures and agitation in
adults and children, and they effectively man-
age organophosphate-induced status epilep-
ticus and mitigate neuronal injury in animal
models. 10,11
5. Health care professionals not wearing appro-
priate PPE have developed symptoms con-
sistent with organophosphate exposure after
being in close contact with adults and chil-
dren poisoned by organophosphates, including
patients with respiratory and dermal exposures
only.12–15 Appropriate health care professional
PPE depends on the circumstances of the
organophosphate exposure and potency of the
involved organophosphate.
6. Dermal decontamination through removal of
contaminated clothing and copious irrigation
with soap and water performed by people wear-
ing protective barriers is effective at preventing
further absorption and prevents contamination
of caregivers and the care environment.1
7 and 8. Metanalysis of 3 RCTs of primarily adults
with organophosphate poisoning treated with
oximes versus placebo did not find a mortal-
ity benefit. The 3 studies were heterogenous,
used lower doses of pralidoxime, and all had
risks of biases.16 Two high-dose versus low-
dose pralidoxime RCTs of primarily adults with
moderate to severe organophosphate poison-
ing favored the high-dose groups with greater
survival, lower rates of pneumonia, and lower
```
mean atropine doses (see Table 4 for dosing
```
```
information).17 These findings are consistent
```
with pralidoxime-induced protection with and
without atropine against lethality in a rodent
model of organophosphate poisoning.18 Oximes
```
are not universally effective; their effective-
```
ness may be limited by rapid aging of some
```
organophosphates (eg, tabun), their inability
```
to cross the blood-brain barrier, structural dif-
ferences among organophosphates, and rapid
reinactivation of regenerated acetylcholines-
terase in the presence of poison.4,5 Although
the available data are not sufficient to support

Cao et al Special Circumstances: 2025 AHA Guidelines for CPR and ECC
Synopsis
Many poisons block cardiac sodium channels with prop-
erties similar to Vaughan-Williams class Ia or Ic antiar-
rhythmics. Sodium channel blocker poisoning causes
QRS prolongation, hypotension, seizures, ventricular ar-
rhythmias, and cardiovascular collapse. Characteristic
electrocardiogram changes usually precede ventricular
arrhythmias in patients with sodium channel blocker poi-
soning. These include intraventricular conduction delay
```
(QRS complex prolongation) and the development of
```
a terminal rightward axis deviation, best appreciated in
```
lead aVR (Figure 9). Many sodium channel blockers have
```
additional effects on other cardiac receptors and ion
channels.1 Although poisoning from tricyclic antidepres-
```
sants (TCAs) is best studied, many other poisons cause
```
life-threatening sodium channel blockade. 2 Treatment
recommendations for poisoning by other sodium channel
blockers are often extrapolated from TCA studies. Man-
agement of life-threatening poisoning from local anes-
thetics, whose pharmacologic action is similar to class
Ib antiarrhythmics, is discussed in the Toxicology: Local
Anesthetics section. The treatment of cocaine poisoning,
which has toxicity unique from other local anesthetics, is
discussed in the Toxicology: Cocaine section. Manage-
ment of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine poisoning,
which is unique, is outside the scope of these guidelines.
These recommendations inform the management of
adults and children with life-threatening sodium channel
blocker poisoning, including cardiac arrest.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1 and 2. Sodium loading and increasing the serum pH
are each supported for the treatment of hypo-
tension and arrhythmia from TCA poisoning by
in vitro studies, animal studies, and case series
and cohort studies of adults and children.3–6
Administration of hypertonic sodium bicarbon-
ate achieves both of these physiologic goals,
though its mechanism is not fully elucidated.
For dosing information, refer to Table 4. This
practice is supported by case series in TCA
poisoning, involving mostly adults.4,5 Whether
the target endpoints of initial hypertonic
sodium bicarbonate bolus therapy should be
```
biochemical (pH ≈7.50) or physiologic (resolu-
```
```
tion of hypotension and QRS prolongation) is
```
debated.3,7–9 After the goals of alkalinization are
achieved, it is not known whether it is superior
to monitor the patient and administer additional
sodium bicarbonate boluses as needed or start
a continuous infusion. 6 Experts recommend
```
avoiding extremes of hypernatremia (serum
```
```
sodium not to exceed 155 mEq/L) and alka-
```
```
lemia (serum pH not to exceed 7.55) to avoid
```
iatrogenic harm.3,6,10 If pH exceeds 7.55 and
serum sodium is below 155 mEq/L, serum
sodium can be increased by administration of
```
hypertonic saline; if serum sodium exceeds
```
155 mEq/L and pH is below 7.55, pH can be

controlled by adjusting minute ventilation in
intubated adults and children.5,11,12
3. Observational data from adults and children
```
(≥15 years of age) suggest that patients with
```
tricyclic antidepressant poisoning who are
treated with mechanical hyperventilation in
addition to sodium bicarbonate may be more
likely to achieve controlled alkalemia and cor-
rection of QRS prolongation compared with
those receiving sodium bicarbonate alone. 5
```
The clinical threshold for intubation is unclear;
```
in adults and children who are intubated, min-
ute ventilation can be adjusted to achieve pH
targets.5,11
4. ECLS, including VA-ECMO, has been used
successfully in adult cases with refractory car-
diogenic shock from sodium channel blocker
poisoning.13–17 One retrospective cohort study
```
comparing 14 poisoned adults (7 poisoned
```
```
by sodium channel blockers) treated with
```
```
ECLS with 48 poisoned adults (14 poisoned
```
```
by sodium channel blockers) with conventional
```
therapies found that ECLS was associated with
a lower mortality rate in the overall cohorts.18
The study did not have a subgroup analysis of
only sodium channel blocker poisoning. There
is a single case report of a child with cardiac
arrest secondary to TCA poisoning who was
successfully treated with VA-ECMO.19 No con-
trolled observational studies or clinical trials
were identified. Further discussion of the use
of VA-ECMO in poisoning is provided in the
```
Toxicology: ECMO section.
```
5. The use of sodium bicarbonate to treat sodium
channel blocker poisoning other than from
TCAs is based on case reports of adult poison-
ing by other sodium channel blockers. 3,20–23 No
pediatric data were identified, thus, the recom-
mendation for children is extrapolated from the
adult data. For dosing information in adults and
children, refer to Table 4.
6. Lidocaine, a class Ib antidysrhythmic, competes
with Ia and Ic antiarrhythmics for binding at the
sodium channel. Class Ib antiarrhythmics dis-
sociate from the receptor more rapidly than
Ia or Ic agents, such as TCAs, and, therefore,
do not depress phase 0 depolarization.24 The
use of lidocaine to treat wide-complex tachy-
cardia from TCA overdose is supported by
animal studies and case reports of adults and
children.24 A similar role for phenytoin, another
class Ib antiarrhythmic, is supported by adult
case reports, though not consistently by animal
studies. 24–27
7. Most sodium channel blockers are highly
lipophilic. Several case reports in adults and
children describe temporal improvement fol-
lowing ILE administration, including suc-
cessful treatment of TCA-induced cardiac
arrest. 28–37 However, an RCT published in
abstract form only found no benefit from ILE
administration in treatment of hypotension or
electrocardiogram abnormalities from TCA
poisoning. 38 The administration of ILE may
increase drug absorption in oral overdose in
an animal model, and results of animal stud-
ies are inconsistent. 39–43 Nonetheless, existing
evidence-based recommendations suggest
ILE administration after failure of standard
therapies for life-threatening amitriptyline
poisoning, particularly if VA-ECMO or other
forms of mechanical circulatory support are
not readily available. 44

TOXICOLOGY: SYMPATHOMIMETICS
```
Introduction
The hallmark of sympathomimetic poisoning is increased
activity of the adrenergic nervous system. Amphetamines,
cathinones, and some synthetic cannabinoids produce
sympathomimetic poisoning. Management of severe
```
cocaine poisoning is discussed separately (refer to the
```
```
Toxicology: Cocaine section). Complications of sympa-
```
thomimetic poisoning result from excessive catechol-
amine release and an attendant increase in metabolic
and psychomotor activity. Clinical manifestations include
tachycardia, hypertension, agitation, seizures, hyperther-
mia, rhabdomyolysis, and acidosis.1–4
Sympathomimetic poisoning can cause sudden car-
diac arrest, presenting as VF, VT, or PEA. 5–9 Vasospasm
can cause myocardial infarction, even in patients with
```
normal coronary arteries. 6,8,10,11 A stress (takotsubo)
```
cardiomyopathy is also reported in sympathomimetic-
```
poisoned patients; this condition can be fatal, but it
```
resolves spontaneously in survivors. 10,12–15 Hyperther-
mia is a severe and rapidly life-threatening clinical
manifestation. 3–5,16,17
These recommendations inform the management of
adults and children with life-threatening sympathomi-
metic poisoning, including cardiac arrest.

Recommendations for Adults With Life-Threatening Sympathomimetic
Poisoning
COR LOE Recommendations
1 B-NR 1. Sedation is recommended for adults with severeagitation from sympathomimetic poisoning.
1 C-LD
2. Rapid external cooling with ice water immersion
is recommended for adults with life-threatening
```
hyperthermia (Core Temperature >40 °C [104 °F])
```
from sympathomimetic poisoning.
2a C-EO
3. Vasodilators (eg, nitrates, phentolamine, CCBs)
are reasonable for adults with coronary vasospasm
from sympathomimetic poisoning.
2a C-EO
4. It is reasonable to use ECLS in adults with
cardiogenic shock from sympathomimetic
poisoning refractory to other treatment measures.
2b C-LD
5. The usefulness of dantrolene is uncertain for
adults with life-threatening hyperthermia from
MDMA toxicity.
3: Harm C-LD 6. Prolonged use of physical restraint withoutsedation for adults is potentially harmful.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. Sedatives (eg, benzodiazepines, antipsychotics)
have been used in animal experiments to treat
sympathomimetic poisoning.18,19 Sedatives con-
trol psychomotor agitation that produces heat and
rhabdomyolysis. Antipsychotics control agitation.
Benzodiazepines mitigate agitation, relax muscles,
and treat seizures. Although several adult clinical
trials compare specific therapies for severe psycho-
motor agitation, it is difficult to separate patients with
sympathomimetic poisoning from other patients in
these studies, and cardiac arrest was rare.20–24
2. Hyperthermia (Core Temperature >40 °C [104 °F])
is rapidly life-threatening in sympathomimetic poi-
soning.25 External and immersive cooling has been
used to treat hyperthermia in adults and a 17-year-
old patient with sympathomimetic poisoning.5,26–28
Evaporative or immersive cooling modalities reduce
temperature more rapidly in adults than cooling blan-
kets, the application of cold packs, or endovascular
cooling devices.29–33 Ice water immersion resulted in
the fastest cooling rates in adults and critically may
```
cool faster than 0.15 °C/min (0.27 °F/min), which has
```
been associated with increased survival.34,35 High-
quality data on cooling measures for hyperthermic
sympathomimetic patients are lacking, but immersion
```
seems effective (refer to the Hyperthermia section).28
```
3. Vasodilators, including alpha-adrenergic receptor
antagonists, CCBs, and nitrates, have been used
to treat coronary vasospasm, reversing electrocar-
diographic and biochemical markers of ischemia in
sympathomimetic-poisoned adults.36–38
4. ECLS, including VA-ECMO and intra-aortic bal-
loon pump, has been used successfully to support
cardiac output in adults in cardiogenic shock while
stress cardiomyopathy resolves.10,13,39,40 Stress
```
(takotsubo) cardiomyopathy can be fatal, but it
```
often spontaneously resolves in days to weeks
with circulatory support.
5. Data on dantrolene for MDMA-induced hyper-
thermia is conflicting. A meta-analysis of patients
aged ≥15 years only identified case reports and
series totaling 71 cases and found that dantrolene
use was associated with improved survival, but a
nonrandomized series of 9 adults with MDMA-
induced hyperthermia did not find clinical differ-
ences between patients who received dantrolene
and those who did not.41,42
6. Although physical restraints may be necessary
temporarily, their sustained use without effective
sedation is associated with death in adults with
severe agitation from exposure to cocaine and
other sympathomimetics.37,43–45

Recommendation for Adults and Children With Life-Threatening
Poisoning Following Volatile Hydrocarbon Exposure
COR LOE Recommendation
2b C-EO
1. It may be reasonable to use β-adrenergic
antagonists for adults and children with ventricular
arrhythmias refractory to standard therapy.
Synopsis
Cardiac arrest following volatile hydrocarbon use has
been termed sudden sniffing death.1 While the exact
mechanism is unknown, in vitro and animal experiments
suggest that hydrocarbons sensitize cardiac potassium,
sodium, and calcium channels. 2–5 Hypoxia, catecholamine
```
surge, or hypocalcemia (from fluorinated hydrocarbons)
```
may also contribute to lethal arrhythmias. Animals treat-
ed with chloroform, a nonhydrocarbon volatile, have en-
hanced sensitivity to epinephrine, which led to death in
some animals.6,7 In a large case series, sudden death
was frequently reported following exertion or a stressful
situation.1
This recommendation informs the management of
adults and children with life-threatening arrhythmias
from volatile hydrocarbon exposure, including cardiac
arrest.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. β-adrenergic antagonists decrease myocardial
sensitivity to epinephrine. Several case reports
describe resuscitation with a β-adrenergic antago-
nist for cardiac arrest from volatile hydrocarbons. A
23-year-old patient suffered pulseless VT cardiac
arrest following inhalation of 1,1-difluoroethane.
In addition to amiodarone and defibrillation, recur-
rent VT was successfully treated with calcium,
dexmedetomidine, esmolol, and cardiac bypass. 8

infarction and VT after inhalation of a keyboard
cleaner containing difluoroethane. Despite amio-
darone, lidocaine, and metoprolol, the patient
died of refractory cardiogenic shock. 9 The use of
β-adrenergic antagonists is further supported by
the extrapolation of data from withholding epi-
nephrine. In a case series of 22 patients aged ≥13
years with cardiac arrest from volatile hydrocar-
bons, none of the 8 patients receiving epineph-
rine survived, while 5 of the 6 patients who did not
receive epinephrine survived with good neurologi-
cal outcome. 10

Recommendations for the Use of VA-ECMO in Adults and Children With
Life-Threatening Poisoning
COR LOE Recommendations
2a B-NR
1. It is reasonable to use VA-ECMO in adults and
children with persistent cardiogenic shock or
cardiac arrest due to poisoning that is refractory to
pharmacological interventions.
2a C-EO
2. It is reasonable to use VA-ECMO in adults
and children with persistent arrhythmias due to
poisoning when other treatments fail.
2b C-LD
3. For adults and children with life-threatening
poisoning, the effectiveness of VA-ECMO for
poisoned patients with cardiovascular collapse
from causes other than cardiogenic shock or
arrhythmia has not been established.
Synopsis
VA-ECMO is a resuscitative measure providing both car-
diac and pulmonary support. 1 In the setting of poisoning,
VA-ECMO treats refractory cardiogenic shock by provid-
ing mechanical circulatory support while the offending
poison is eliminated. The use of VA-ECMO in both poi-
soned adults and children is limited by availability, logis-
tics of transport, patient comorbidities, and risks inherent
to the procedure. Decisions to initiate VA-ECMO involve
the understanding of both the pathophysiology of the
specific poisoning and the clinical features of the patient
and may include consultation from a poison center or
medical toxicologist.
Other forms of mechanical circulatory support, such
as implanted LVADs and percutaneous mechanical circu-
```
latory support devices (eg, intra-aortic balloon pump) are
```
beyond the scope of this recommendation.
These recommendations inform the management
of adults and children with life-threatening poisoning,
including cardiac arrest.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. In a retrospective cohort study of 64 adults
treated with VA-ECMO for cardiac arrest or
refractory shock regardless of cause, cardiotoxic
poisoning was independently associated with sur-
vival. 2 A nonrandomized observational study of
adults in cardiac arrest due to poisoning treated
with VA-ECMO showed lower mortality than other
patients treated with VA-ECMO and lower mor-
tality compared with poisoned patients treated
with standard critical care and antidotal therapy
alone. 3 In a prospective observational study of 32
adults placed on VA-ECMO to treat cardiogenic
shock or refractory cardiac arrest from poisoning,
78% of patients survived to hospital discharge. 4 A
review of 407 patients with poisoning treated with
either VA-ECMO or venovenous ECMO reported
to the National Poison Data System included 75
patients <12 years of age and found similar mor-
```
tality rates for adults and children (29.5% versus
```
```
32.0%, respectively). 5 Significant complications
```
with VA-ECMO treatment include limb ischemia,
bleeding, stroke, and infection. 1,4,6 Studies have
reported complications of VA-ECMO following
administration of lipid emulsion therapy, includ-
ing cracking of stopcocks, clogging and malfunc-
tion of the membrane oxygenator, and increased
blood clot and lipid aggregation in the circuits. 7,8
However, multiple case reports reported success-
ful treatment with VA-ECMO concurrent with lipid
emulsion therapy. 8,9
2. For adults and children with persistent nonperfus-
ing arrhythmias, VA-ECMO provides antegrade
blood flow to allow poison elimination. Case reports

```
Cao et al Special Circumstances: 2025 AHA Guidelines for CPR and ECC
describe neurologically intact survival with the use of
VA-ECMO to support adult cases of poisoning with
persistent arrhythmias.10–13 One adult case resulted
in return to normal sinus rhythm, but the patient
subsequently suffered multisystem organ failure.14
Similar to adults, there are case series and case
reports of the use of VA-ECMO to treat children
with persistent arrhythmias following poisoning.15,16
3. The mortality benefit of VA-ECMO is mixed in poi-
sonings that cause refractory vasodilatory shock
with preserved cardiac function, direct cellular
toxicity, disruption of cellular oxygen use, or poi-
sonings that are almost universally fatal despite
temporary cardiac support. One retrospective
registry study of patients reported to the National
Poison Data System, including 75 children <12
years of age, showed that patients with hemato-
logical and metabolic poisons had higher mortality
on ECMO compared with patients with other poi-
```
sonings; however, this study was unable to deter-
```
mine the mode of ECMO utilized. 5 In contrast, in
1 retrospective case series, 80% of children <18
years of age who were treated with VA-ECMO
```
(with or without continuous kidney replacement
```
```
therapy) for vasodilatory shock from poisoning
```
survived. 17 Similarly, multiple case reports have
demonstrated mortality benefit of VA-ECMO for
adults with cardiogenic shock, hypotension, and
arrhythmias in the setting of aluminum phos-
phide poisoning, a pesticide and rodenticide that
when exposed to water produces phosphine gas,
a direct cellular toxin that causes depression of
myocardial contractility and ventricular arrhyth-
mias. 18 The pathophysiology of these poisons is
not expected to differ significantly between adults
and children, including aluminum phosphide.

KNOWLEDGE GAPS AND PRIORITIES OF
RESEARCH
Cardiac arrest and life-threatening states due to special
circumstances are vastly under-researched. As part of
the overall work for the development of these guidelines,
the writing group reviewed a large amount of literature
concerning the management of cardiac arrest and life-
threatening states due to special circumstances. One
expected challenge faced through this process was the
lack of data in many areas. With some exceptions, car-
diac arrests due to special circumstances are rare events
and challenging to study. As a result, only the majority
of guideline recommendations were based on low-grade
```
evidence (LOE C).
```
Some critical knowledge gaps identified by the writing
group are summarized in Table 5.

Alternative CPR
Are there situations when a precordial thump can be used safely in adults and children in cardiac arrest in a well-monitored setting when a defibrillator is not
immediately available?
Is percussion pacing more effective than transcutaneous pacing in adults and children with witnessed, monitored, in-hospital onset of asystole or a
nonperfusing bradyarrhythmia before loss of consciousness?
